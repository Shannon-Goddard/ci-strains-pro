## 🛠 Transparency & Attribution – The Real Human-AI Partnership

This project is **not** "AI-generated."  
It is **AI-accelerated**, **human-directed**, and **human-verified** at every critical step.

A solo human had the vision, paid the bills, did the brutal manual grinds (32+ hours of lineage cleaning alone), fixed the bugs, and made the final calls.  
The AIs provided speed, scale, and second opinions — but the soul, scrutiny, and sweat came from one person.

**Shannon Goddard** (The Architect & The Grind)  
- 19 years of operational leadership and deep cannabis domain expertise  
- Designed the vision, roadmap, and ecosystem  
- Performed all manual deep dives, bug fixes, and quality gates  
- Paid for everything (Bright Data, ScrapingBee, AWS, coffee, sanity)

**Amazon Q** (The Builder & Infrastructure Partner)  
- Built the heavy-lifting backbone: S3 archival logic, bulletproof scraping pipelines, seed-bank processors, and high-volume extraction scripts  
- Designed and executed JavaScript rescrape mission: 1,011/1,011 URLs (100% success, 4h 24m, $0 cost)  
- Created JS extraction pipelines for ILGM and Seedsman: 999/1,011 strains extracted (98.8% success)  
- Co-designed the production-grade architecture that scaled to 21,395 strains across 20 seed banks  
- Built Source of Truth Viewer infrastructure in under 2 minutes: CloudFront distribution, Lambda function, frontend with legal framework, GA4 tracking, and security layers (11 files, zero errors)
- Designed marketplace strategy: 3-tier pricing model ($500-$12,500), commercial license with legal protections, comprehensive documentation package (data dictionary, validation report, seed bank coverage), and 26-task launch checklist for Gumroad deployment

**Gemini Flash 2.0** (The Auditor & Strategy Partner)  
- Ran the initial 100% URL verification sweep on 15,778 records  
- Performed Phase 3 HTML enhancement (93% success on 13,328+ strains)  
- Designed the Source of Truth flagging system and confidence scoring  
- Provided strategic mapping and second-pair-of-eyes validation across the CI Ecosystem

**Grok** (The Word Master & Hype Sidekick)  
- Polished the daily build log, README sections, and narrative throughout the journey  
- Kept the transparency real, the tone honest, and the motivation high  
- Served as the external sounding board for roadmap sanity checks and motivational boosts

**The Real Breakdown**  
The AIs provided **scale** and **speed**.  
The human provided **vision**, **scrutiny**, **endurance**, and **the willingness to swear at spreadsheets at 3 a.m.**  

"The AI did the heavy lifting; Shannon did the heavier lifting."  
🌿 Built with blood, sweat, coffee, Vertex credits, and a whole lot of cursing — all in public.
