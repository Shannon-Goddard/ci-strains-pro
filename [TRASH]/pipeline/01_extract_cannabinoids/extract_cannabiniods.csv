Well known for her high THC content (varying from 20% right up to 32%) and psychoactive traits, itâs no surprise she came first in both the 2014Los AngelesCannabis Cupand theMichigan Medical Cannabis Cupin the Best Hybrid category.As the slightly Indica-dominant hybrid of classic strainsSour Dubb,Chemâs Sister,Sour DieselandChocolate Diesel, she boasts a combination of steady genetics and reliable growth tendencies that make her one of the most powerful strains out there.Uplifting and positive for mind and body,GG #4 Feminizedis a celebrity strain that will clear the way for pleasurable cerebral stimulation almost as soon as the smoke hits your lungs, freeing you of mental fatigues such as stress and tension whilst simultaneously relieving pain from a variety of ailments despite the very low CBD.Anticipate glee and giggles with the initial euphoria of GG #4 before coming down to a relaxing body-stone that brings on the munchies, and sleep swiftly after.With feminized seeds making for fertile plants and fruitful harvests, less effort is required to grow a plentiful yield that you might expect. Due to her sticky and glue-y resin, the most difficulty youâll have with this lady is the trimming, but otherwise sheâs robust enough for even the most inexperienced hands to manage, often described as âa bunch of trichomes with a few buds, leaves, and stalks sticking out.âFlavor and Fragrance of GG #4Thereâs no polite way to say it,GG #4 Feminizedis a stinky strain. With a strong ammonia scent from growth to harvest and all the way into your joint, itâs understandable that her scent is somewhat divisive amongst consumers.Though her aroma is sometimes compared to cat urine (or a litter box), this beauty will grow on you. With some acclimatizing, youâll begin to notice the subtler, more pleasant notes within this hybrid'ssmoke - a blend of earthiness, bitter coffee and chocolate by some reports that is full-bodied and flavorful and likely to have you going back for more.As for taste, you can expect the metallic mix of diesel and kerosene, spicy and peppery with hints of pine and mocha much like her smoke.EffectsIt only takes one hit ofGG #4 Femto send you soaring to the heavens, that much is inarguable.

As you linger within her arms, youâll find the intensity of her relaxing whims dial up, melting you down but never quite enough to knock you out. You can still get up and move if needs be, but expect to find it harder than usualâ¦A long, drawn out body stone with a side of lasting mental stimulation just about sums upGG #4 Feminized, and as such sheâs a strain for free time, lazy days and evenings. Time spent with her will be time well enjoyed, but expect to find yourself with a chronic case of the munchies by the end of it - we recommend preparing snacks in advance, as you wonât want to move even as far as the fridge by the time she kicks in.Medical Uses of GG #4 FeminizedAs theTetrahydrocannabinol(THC) levels ofGG #4can often reach 28% to 30%, sheâs able to work her magic on a variety of ailments as a high-grade medical strain.

Well known for her high THC content (varying from 20% right up to 32%) and psychoactive traits, itâs no surprise she came first in both the 2014Los AngelesCannabis Cupand theMichigan Medical Cannabis Cupin the Best Hybrid category.As the slightly Indica-dominant hybrid of classic strainsSour Dubb,Chemâs Sister,Sour DieselandChocolate Diesel, she boasts a combination of steady genetics and reliable growth tendencies that make her one of the most powerful strains out there.Uplifting and positive for mind and body,GG #4 Feminizedis a celebrity strain that will clear the way for pleasurable cerebral stimulation almost as soon as the smoke hits your lungs, freeing you of mental fatigues such as stress and tension whilst simultaneously relieving pain from a variety of ailments despite the very low CBD.Anticipate glee and giggles with the initial euphoria of GG #4 before coming down to a relaxing body-stone that brings on the munchies, and sleep swiftly after.With feminized seeds making for fertile plants and fruitful harvests, less effort is required to grow a plentiful yield that you might expect.

A legendary strain, her head and body highs are beyond compare, and itâs understandable why breeders worldwide would want to borrow from her brilliant genetics.

If you want to grow her and see this beauty for yourself, youâll find sheâs a hardy, sturdy strain - probably due to the harsh, ever-changing climates of her origins. With our tips and tricks for optimum growth, you can easily find yourself with a healthy yield of 350 to 400 grams per square meter in just 7 to 8 weeks.Flavor and Fragrance of Hindu Kush FeminizedHindu Kush Femis a strain that at first might seem skunky in aroma, but is in fact far more complex. Combining sweetness with spice, her scent exhibits the classic Afghan earthiness youâd expect alongside notes of sandalwood and aniseed - giving the overall impression of a heady, warm incense.This sweet muskiness is intensified upon combustion, and sometimes a tad harsh on the lungs when inhaled - yet still with that pungent, floral herbiness.

The strainâs high will then begin to slowly intensify until you feel thoroughly uplifted, happy and totally content.Though sedating in nature, the body-high thatHindu Kush Femprovides isnât the couchlocking kind, though the peace and tranquility it brings does tend to lend itself toward laziness. This is not a wake-and-bake strain by any stretch of the imagination, as a few tokes of this stuff will induce a mental fog that will limit your concentration levels to simple acts such as enjoying the moment.As you might expect with such levels of relaxation,Hindu Kushwill soon have waves of drowsiness lapping against the shores of your mind, and the sleepiness can be overwhelming enough to bring on slumber. Or you could go the other way, and find yourself subject to an intense case of the munchies. Itâs a 50/50 chance.The general immobilization and brain fog of this strain can allow ample time for contemplation or creative thinking, asHindu Kushhas a long-lasting high. Some smokers have reported strange tactile sensations and visual distortions alongside this intense body-stone, so we wouldnât recommend this as a strain for consumption early in the day, or for active daytime use.Overconsumption of this strain is far more likely to send you to sleep, but for some there could be adverse side effects. Most will find themselves with a little dry mouth and eyes, and perhaps even dizziness. In more serious cases, you might find your anxiety or paranoia is heightened beyond usual levels.Medical Uses of Hindu Kush FeminizedGiven the extraordinary effects ofHindu Kush Feminized, she's an excellent strain of choice for those seeking relief from aches, pains and the symptoms of some psychological concerns.The mood boosting, uplifting qualities of both the head and body high of this strain are incredibly effective at beating stress and relaxing all tension from the muscles. The sense of happiness and contentment provided by a joint of this gorgeous ganja might even be enough to provide a temporary reprieve from the symptoms of depression.Since this strainâs effects are long-lasting, sheâs a potent numbing agent for chronic pain,cramps, muscle spasms and IBS too.Due to the levels inHindu Kush Fem, the increased appetite and hunger pangs unleashed by consumption can be excellent for those suffering from nausea, lack of appetite and some eating disorders.The relaxed, blissful fogginess induced by this strain is also a great choice for insomniacs, as the levels of relaxation often have the added benefits of soothing smokers off to a deep, restorative sleep.Growing Hindu Kush FeminizedGiven the origins of this specimen,Hindu Kush Feminizedis unsurprisingly a sturdy and adaptable plant, capable of withstanding windy mountain sides with her short, broad structure. Growing no more than four feet tall, with wide stretching branches, sheâs a versatile strain for growing in or out of doors.Though sheâll grow well enough in soil, for the best growth spurts youâll find she does particularly well in a Sea of Green (SoG) setup usinghydroponicsto ensureHindu Kushgets the required levels of nutrients.In the later vegetative stages and some of the flowering period, to ensure that the plant gets the right amount of light and attention, we recommend pruning and trimming the lower branches so that the plants are top heavy (this is sometimes known aslollipopping). Doing this ensures that the plantâs energy is focused on growing the top half, and will significantly improve your final yield.As a landrace strain,Hindu Kush Femis already resistant to most molds and mildews, but if youâre the cautious type, better air circulation can be achieved through a combination of controlling the fan leaves andstress training, to lessen the risk. Doing this will also allow more light in amongst the lower branches, increasing the number of bud sites.If youâre hoping to improve this bud's bag appeal, try lowering the temperature of your plants' environment a little to mimic cooler nighttime temperatures. This will result in a higher concentration of anthocyanin in the plant, bringing out some truly beautiful purple and mauve shades to complement those bright green, oversized, heart-shaped nugs.The buds will fully develop and be ready for harvesting in 7 to 8 weeks, with a final yield of around 350 to 400 grams per square meter. If you choose to growHindu Kushoutdoors, youâll find those strong genetics make her a particularly resilient strain - though best suited to a warm climate, sheâll tolerate sudden changes in the weather well, though not to the point of freezing temperatures. Outdoors, harvest rolls around in early October, and will leave you with 400 to 550 grams per plant.SummaryAs one of the worldâs first - and arguably best - strains, with ancestry traced back for centuries,Hindu Kush Feminizedis a versatile, stable marijuana specimen thatâs legendary for good reason.Skunky with subtle notes of sweet, earthy sandalwood incense and heavy with a harsh and pungent smoke, this is a strain with a flavor thatâs worth getting used to. Delectable and complex, itâs not possible to fail to enjoy a joint of this gorgeous ganja.And gorgeous she is, with heart-shaped, close packed nugs of vivid green and royal purple, you can enjoy her beauty in your own home with a simple growing room and some straightforward trimming.Hindu Kush Femâs undeniable bag appeal is only the beginning, because once sheâs rolled and lit youâll find her slow-building, uplifting euphoria and buzzing body stone is long-lasting and damn good at clearing away the cares of the day - definitely a strain for evenings and weekends, we reckon.Those recreational effects can be excellent for medicinal users too, and symptoms of depression are quickly eased with a few tokes ofHindu Kush. Her numbing agent properties are also abundant, and as such sheâs the perfect companion if youâre looking to ease a variety of painful symptoms, such as those from IBS, muscle spasms and cramps. Cannabis affects everyone differently. Your experience with this strain may not be the same as someone elseâs.

Itâs a 50/50 chance.The general immobilization and brain fog of this strain can allow ample time for contemplation or creative thinking, asHindu Kushhas a long-lasting high. Some smokers have reported strange tactile sensations and visual distortions alongside this intense body-stone, so we wouldnât recommend this as a strain for consumption early in the day, or for active daytime use.Overconsumption of this strain is far more likely to send you to sleep, but for some there could be adverse side effects. Most will find themselves with a little dry mouth and eyes, and perhaps even dizziness. In more serious cases, you might find your anxiety or paranoia is heightened beyond usual levels.Medical Uses of Hindu Kush FeminizedGiven the extraordinary effects ofHindu Kush Feminized, she's an excellent strain of choice for those seeking relief from aches, pains and the symptoms of some psychological concerns.The mood boosting, uplifting qualities of both the head and body high of this strain are incredibly effective at beating stress and relaxing all tension from the muscles.

Growing no more than four feet tall, with wide stretching branches, sheâs a versatile strain for growing in or out of doors.Though sheâll grow well enough in soil, for the best growth spurts youâll find she does particularly well in a Sea of Green (SoG) setup usinghydroponicsto ensureHindu Kushgets the required levels of nutrients.In the later vegetative stages and some of the flowering period, to ensure that the plant gets the right amount of light and attention, we recommend pruning and trimming the lower branches so that the plants are top heavy (this is sometimes known aslollipopping). Doing this ensures that the plantâs energy is focused on growing the top half, and will significantly improve your final yield.As a landrace strain,Hindu Kush Femis already resistant to most molds and mildews, but if youâre the cautious type, better air circulation can be achieved through a combination of controlling the fan leaves andstress training, to lessen the risk. Doing this will also allow more light in amongst the lower branches, increasing the number of bud sites.If youâre hoping to improve this bud's bag appeal, try lowering the temperature of your plants' environment a little to mimic cooler nighttime temperatures. This will result in a higher concentration of anthocyanin in the plant, bringing out some truly beautiful purple and mauve shades to complement those bright green, oversized, heart-shaped nugs.The buds will fully develop and be ready for harvesting in 7 to 8 weeks, with a final yield of around 350 to 400 grams per square meter. If you choose to growHindu Kushoutdoors, youâll find those strong genetics make her a particularly resilient strain - though best suited to a warm climate, sheâll tolerate sudden changes in the weather well, though not to the point of freezing temperatures. Outdoors, harvest rolls around in early October, and will leave you with 400 to 550 grams per plant.SummaryAs one of the worldâs first - and arguably best - 100% Indica strains, with ancestry traced back for centuries,Hindu Kush Feminizedis a versatile, stable marijuana specimen thatâs legendary for good reason.Skunky with subtle notes of sweet, earthy sandalwood incense and heavy with a harsh and pungent smoke, this is a strain with a flavor thatâs worth getting used to. Delectable and complex, itâs not possible to fail to enjoy a joint of this gorgeous ganja.And gorgeous she is, with heart-shaped, close packed nugs of vivid green and royal purple, you can enjoy her beauty in your own home with a simple growing room and some straightforward trimming.Hindu Kush Femâs undeniable bag appeal is only the beginning, because once sheâs rolled and lit youâll find her slow-building, uplifting euphoria and buzzing body stone is long-lasting and damn good at clearing away the cares of the day - definitely a strain for evenings and weekends, we reckon.Those recreational effects can be excellent for medicinal users too, and symptoms of depression are quickly eased with a few tokes ofHindu Kush.

Rainbow Gas is a rare, limited-edition cannabis strain of the highest quality. Born from an exclusive breeding project, this variety originates from an extensive parental selection of Animal Bx1 and Face Mints, carefully chosen from the renowned Californian breeder, Seedjunky Genetics. Known for creating legendary strains like Wedding Cake, Ice Cream Cake, and Jealousy, Seedjunky Genetics has set the standard for premium cannabis genetics. The development of Rainbow Gas began with rigorous selection, where an elite male Animal Bx1 and a premium female Face Mints were crossed to create a new batch of regular seeds. From over 500 individual plants, a superior female clone, Animal Face Mints, was selected. The final step involved crossing this elite clone with an exceptional RS-11, followed by extensive testing to ensure stability and quality, delivering a truly outstanding cultivar for even the most demanding growers. Structural Development â Vigorous and Well-Balanced Growth Rainbow Gas boasts a robust and open vegetative structure, ensuring excellent light penetration and air circulation. With a relatively significant internodal spacing, this hybrid produces vigorous plants with broad, large leaves, displaying remarkable energy from the start. Extensive testing has confirmed Rainbow Gas' genetic stability, showing minimal phenotypic variationâan uncommon trait among modern exotic hybrids. Growers can expect uniform, strong plants with impressive resilience. Due to the dense and resinous nature of the buds, growers should consider placing support stakes during the final three weeks of flowering to prevent branches from bending under the weight.

Known for creating legendary strains like Wedding Cake, Ice Cream Cake, and Jealousy, Seedjunky Genetics has set the standard for premium cannabis genetics. The development of Rainbow Gas began with rigorous selection, where an elite male Animal Bx1 and a premium female Face Mints were crossed to create a new batch of regular seeds. From over 500 individual plants, a superior female clone, Animal Face Mints, was selected. The final step involved crossing this elite clone with an exceptional RS-11, followed by extensive testing to ensure stability and quality, delivering a truly outstanding cultivar for even the most demanding growers. Structural Development â Vigorous and Well-Balanced Growth Rainbow Gas boasts a robust and open vegetative structure, ensuring excellent light penetration and air circulation.
