Growing her indoors,Grandaddy Brucewill thrive in a temperature range of 21Â° to 26Â°C, and prefers a humidity level between the 40% and 50% mark.

Seeds Supreme,https://seedsupreme.com/afghan-feminized.html,Afghan,"A Pure Indica History LessonBud BasicsAfghanhas been released and re-released in all manner of weird and wonderful forms over the years. One of the most popular choices for growers beingAfghan Feminized, an all-time superstar strain thatâ€™s all choice and no compromise.With her origins firmly rooted in the Middle East,Afghancannabis has been enjoyed in one form or another for centuries. Thereâ€™s a time and place for high-techhybridsand sophisticated cannabis cocktails, butAfghan Feminizedis just about as untouched and untainted as it gets. Admittedly, aside from the fact that this version has been engineered to ensure 100%female plants, 100% of the time.Across the board, this iconic beauty is everything youâ€™d expect a quality Indica to be. On the nose, itâ€™s the classic spicy, peppery and hash-like fragrance that immediately sends you on a sensory magic carpet ride.This strainâ€™s 100% pure Indica genetics guarantee an almostexclusively physical stone, which nonetheless brings a welcome dose of euphoria into the mix. THC levels hover around the 20% mark, though often test as high as 25%.Afghan Feminizedis also notorious for producing Biblical quantities of resin, making her perfect for DIY extracts andhashproduction. A strain thatâ€™s worthy of her position among the all-time greats,Afghanâ€™sgenetics are the reason we have strains likeBlueberry, Northern Lightsand dozens of other modern classics.Best of all, as long as you can provide your plants with relatively warm and stable conditions, these lovely ladies can be an absolute gift to grow. Even where space is at a premium this stuff produces like itâ€™s a competition.Flavor and Fragrance of AfghanThe three primary terpenes inAfghan Feminizedare myrcene (herbal), pinene (pine) and ocimene (minty).On the nose, thereâ€™s an immediate and enticing hash-like fragrance, with plenty of peppery spice and exotic incense. All of which bursts into life when the buds are broken â€“ even more so when ignited.Thereâ€™s much to be said for the subtler flavors brought out via vaporization, but this is a classic, 100% old-school strain thatâ€™s best smokedâ€¦ period.That said, the flavor is a little on the harsh side and the sharpness of the smoke can have a drying effect on the throat and mouth. Again, this isnâ€™t a sophisticated strain engineered to please â€“ itâ€™s apure and unspoiled specimen, exactly as nature intended. Besides, a little heat and harshness on the throat is a small price to pay for what follows.EffectsThis stuff is, quite simply, as good as Indica weed gets. Itâ€™s no coincidenceAfghanhas become the yardstick by which all other Indicas are measured. Nor was it purely by chance that this special landrace was selected by many of the worldâ€™s most successful breeders over the years when working on their latest hybrids.Afghanis the dictionary definition of everything an Indica strain should be. One or two puffs into the experience, you begin feeling wave after wave of warming tingles making their way through the body. The feeling of heaviness grows until you can barely lift a finger, by which point couch-lock sets in and youâ€™re down for the duration.WithAfghan Feminized, however, youâ€™re not confined to a puddle of fogginess and delirium while the body stone does its thing. Thereâ€™s a deep and intoxicating sense of blissful contentment throughout the entire ride, enabling you to soak up your surroundings and enjoy every second of it.Optimism, positivity and good old-fashioned happiness accompany the sense ofcomplete incapacitation. The only problem being that when the munchies set in (and they will), you might not even have the strength to lift your phone and order a takeout. Hence, youâ€™ll want to plan in advance to avoid this potential nightmare scenario.Medical Uses of Afghan FeminizedMedical marijuana users rave about thefantastic pain-relieving propertiesofAfghan. Quickly getting to work on the entire body with a numbing effect, this is one of the most popular therapeutic strains available for rapid and long-lasting pain relief. Sheâ€™s also great for getting to grips with muscle aches, stiffness, headaches and migraines.Sleep disorders are also no match for this stuff, which in most instances guarantees an exceptional nightâ€™s sleep. One thatâ€™s never followed by the kind of drowsiness and fogginess youâ€™d normally associate with a tranquilizing strain.Afghanâ€™sconnections with the munchies also make her great for tackling bouts of poor appetite, or dealing with nausea.Mild mood issues and everyday stress can also be tackled with the carefully measured intake of these nugs. We say â€˜carefully measuredâ€™ for the simple reason that one toke too many and youâ€™re completely out of action â€“ which may not be your intention.Afghanisnâ€™t known for a tendency to trigger unpleasant side effects, though the intensity of the physical stone can be somewhat overwhelming for novice users. As the THC content of this remarkable strain varies so wildly, itâ€™s best to err on the side of caution and start out slowly.Growing Afghan FeminizedGrowingAfghan Feminizedat home is a relatively simple ride. Itâ€™s best to keep things indoors if youâ€™re not in a warm Mediterranean-like region, but youâ€™ll not be needing a great deal of space for these ladies to do their thing.Youâ€™ll be looking at plants that rarely reach more than 1 meter in height, making these ladies ideal for making use of quiet corners around the home.Short, stocky anddependable for generous yields,Afghan Femplants need only an occasional prune to maintain good air circulation and prevent mold. Quality soil will see you netting just as impressive results as a more advanced cultivation process, so donâ€™t be afraid to keep things simple. 500g for every square meter of grow space is about the average, though can be taken further in ideal outdoor conditions.Physically hiding these tiny plants from sight is easy â€“ camouflaging their stink when they begin flowering is an altogether different matter.SummaryReferring back to an earlier point, thereâ€™s a time and a place for complex and sophisticated cannabis thatâ€™s been precision-engineered with a specific purpose in mind. Thereâ€™s also a time for taking things back to basics and enjoying weed as it has been enjoyed throughout the history of mankind.In the case of the latter,Afghanreally is in a league of her own. Pure, untainted and unspoiled, this is everything an Indica should be. Plus, given the fact that sheâ€™s so simple to grow, thereâ€™s really no excuse fornotmaking this legend a part of your permanent collection.  Cannabis affects everyone differently. Your experience with this strain may not be the same as someone elseâ€™s. Growing conditionsâ€”including light, nutrients, and pot sizeâ€”play a major role in shaping the plantâ€™s yield, potency, and flavor profile. Results will always vary based on how and where itâ€™s grown.",163,

The initial stages of the high are almost exclusively cerebral, often transporting the user into a state of almost dumbfounded euphoria.Shortly after, the Indica genetics begin doing their thing, as a warm and relaxing body stone creeps through the extremities.

That is, unless you go OTT, in which case a prolonged bout of couch-lock is inevitable.Whatâ€™s most enjoyable about Alien OG is how even after youâ€™ve been dealt a body blow, you still benefit from complete mental clarity and sharpness.

This is the kind of strain that can be anything you want her to be, depending on how much you consume and your THC tolerance.For example, the cerebral aspect of the high is perfect for getting to grips with depression, anxiety, ADHD and PTSD. Itâ€™s also great for combating bouts of stress and anxiety, or for simply providing a dose of inspiration and motivation when feeling lazy and lethargic. A few tokes and youâ€™re back at your best, grinning at all thatâ€™s good in the world.On the physical side of things, Alien OG provides the kind of warm and relaxing body stone thatâ€™s great for treating mild to moderate aches and pains. This herbâ€™s also been said to work wonders against headaches, migraines and muscle stiffness, and her associations with the munchies make for a good choice to combat nausea and bouts of poor appetite, with the clear-headedness needed not to make terrible dietary choices at the time.In high enough doses, Alien OG can eventually bring on a state of physical relaxation so intense that it lulls the users into a deep and restful nightâ€™s sleep.

Pretty impressive when considering Alien OGâ€™s potential THC content of up to 28%.If youâ€™re dealing with limited space and can only stretch to one or two plants, a little of this stuff goes a seriously long way.Outdoor yields can be even more impressive, but only where conditions are consistently warm, sunny and relatively stable.

Seeds Supreme,https://seedsupreme.com/big-bud-autoflower.html,Big Bud Autoflower,"Bud originsThe Big Bud strain was created in the US during the 1980s. It was genetically modified in the Netherlands before being brought back to its roots. This hybrid cannabis cultivar contains around 80% indica and 20% sativa genetics. It boasts up to 23% THC and under 1% CBD.The original Big Bud strain is a three-way cross between Afghani, Skunk #1, and Northern Lights. This autoflowering version contains additional ruderalis genetics that give it non-photoperiod traits.Big Bud won first place in the category of Best Indica at the 1989 High Times Cannabis Cup. Itâ€™s survived almost four decades in the 420 world, and itâ€™s not going anywhere soon.Growing Big Bud autoflower seedsItâ€™s relatively straightforward to grow big bud autoflower plants. These crops are suitable for indoor, outdoor, and greenhouse cultivation. We recommend opting for a controlled environment if youâ€™re after top-tier buds and increased autoflower yields.The primary requirement is to keep a stress-free environment, as this non-photoperiod strain doesnâ€™t have enough time to recover from errors. Ensure you select the right pot sizes, keep an eye on the water levels, and keep it safe from harsh weather and other external threats.Big Bud delivers medium-sized plants reaching an average height of four feet. They can stretch to around five feet in favorable outdoor conditions.True to its name, the buds are big and chunky. They boast an intense olive-green hue and a thick layer of resinous trichomes. Orange pistils and purple hairs add extra bag appeal. Add support to the branches during the later phases to account for the heavy weight of the nugs.What climate do these weed seeds prefer?Big Bud seeds thrive in most outdoor setups but prefer warm, dry, and sunny Mediterranean conditions. This hardy strain can withstand cooler climates due to its ruderalis genetics, but itâ€™s not ideal. Sufficient light is essential for development, and autos thrive with 18â€“24 hours daily.Indoors, a hydroponic setup paired with the Sea of Green (SOG) technique offers the best results. Organic soil is equally reliable and improves the terpene profile, leading to explosive flavors.These plants are resistant to pests and diseases. The only thing to be wary of is mold, which may form toward the end of the flowering stage due to bud density. Provide proper airflow to remove excess moisture and check your crops regularly for red flags.Avoid high-stress training like topping. Some light pruning may be necessary to facilitate airflow in the lower leaves. Remember that autoflowers donâ€™t have room to recover from mistakes due to the fast development times and require a stress-free environment at all times.Feeding Big Bud autoThe seedling phase doesnâ€™t require many nutrients, and a well-aerated, organic soil, coco coir, or perlite substrate with sufficient water is enough. Add some nitrogen during vegging, but lower it when flowering starts, and supplement with more phosphorus and potassium.Ensure not to overfeed your autoflower plants, as it will hurt their development. Here are the recommended NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium) ratios for each stage:Seedling: 2:1:2Vegetative: 10:5:5Pre-flowering: 10:10:5Flowering: 5:15:10Flowering & yieldsBig Bud autoflower seeds are non-photoperiod, which means the plants donâ€™t require a light cycle change to begin blooming.They automatically enter the flowering stage around 2â€“4 weeks after germination and remain there for 7â€“9 weeks. Big Bud auto typically completes its life cycle in around 11â€“13 weeks, allowing for multiple harvests a year.The Skunk #1 influence plays a part in the Big Bud autoflower yield. Indoor growers can collect 14â€“16 oz./mÂ² indoors, while outdoor cultivators can expect an average yield of 3â€“6 oz./plant.Experiencing the Big Bud strainThis hybrid marijuana strain comprises 80% indica and 20% sativa genetics. Like with other buds grown from mostly indica seeds, you primarily feel the effects in your body. A cerebral buzz is also on the cards due to the high THC content of around 23%.Thanks to its impressive resin levels and strong potency, Big Bud autoflower is suitable for making concentrates, extracts, and hashish.The strainâ€™s effects set in slowly, making it somewhat of a creeper. The trip begins with a heavy body stone that you can feel from top to bottom. Itâ€™s powerful and typically glues most users to the couch.A dose of cerebral euphoria hits you as well, boosting your mood and making you more creatively inclined. Tension leaves your limbs and joints, and total relaxation takes over before complete sedation sets in. Expect a night of deep sleep afterward.Big Bud is best suited to evenings or lazy days when you have nothing to do. The strain delivers a lazy, fun high that allows you to enjoy your favorite laid-back activities or a chill session with like-minded friends.Common but minor cannabis side effects like dry mouth and eyes are expected, so stay hydrated, satiated, and use eye drops. Other reactions like nausea, dizziness, paranoia, or anxiety may accompany overconsumption, so toke in moderation and regulate your doses.Aroma and flavorThe Afghani and Skunk #1 heritage is clear in the flavor of this strain. Big Bud cannabis seeds produce buds with an array of terpenes, including caryophyllene and humulene.These compounds offer spicy, peppery, clove-like and earthy, herbal, and woody smells, respectively. Thereâ€™s also a fruity undertone in the mix.When toked, these nugs emit a similar flavor, filling your mouth with notes of wood, earth, spice, and a slight grape aftertaste. You might even be teased with a hint of citrus and pine.Helps withApart from its recreational effects, Big Bud reportedly also holds therapeutic value. According to some users, these nugs may offer relief from a range of mental and physical conditions.Its relaxing and sedating properties could assist with insomnia, stress, tension, and anxiety. The uplifting effects might relieve depression and creativity blocks.

Despite having been around for almost 50 years, this weed continues to wipe the floor with the competition.Thereâ€™s a time and a place for all the cutting-edge Diesel Strains, Cheese Strains and Kush Strains out there, but thereâ€™s also nothing quite like settling in with an all-time classic.Bubblegum Feminized is, in every possible respect, the ultimate crowd-pleaser.

The combination of an energizing/uplifting cerebral high and beautifully relaxing body buzz that lingers for hours on end.Truth is, nobody really knows for sure exactly where Bubblegum came from. We know itâ€™s been around since the mid-1970s, but the precise origins and ancestry are unknown. The original inevitably changed and evolved over the years, culminating in 1994 when the strain took up two top prizes at the same Cannabis Cup event. The snowball effect that followed saw Bubblegum collect dozens of prestigious awards over the years, cementing its name and status in cannabis history books.In terms of fragrance, flavor, versatility and ease of cultivation, Bubblegum Feminized outranks almost anything on the market today.

By which point, youâ€™ll be treated to a fantastically fruity and candy-like fragrance, which (unsurprisingly) harks back to old-school bubblegum. Thereâ€™s also a floral quality to the fragrance, punctuated with plenty of wet earth and enticing dampness.The most prolific terpenes present in Bubblegum are myrcene, caryophyllene and pinene, which are renowned for their herbal, pine and peppery qualities accordingly.Set light to these buds and the show-stopping experience intensifies. The skunky qualities of the bud are further intensified, as is the sticky sweetness this legendary strain is famous for. Thereâ€™s the most immense scent of sweet berries and a creamy richness on the exhale, leaving behind a decadent dessert-like aftertaste that lingers indefinitely.EffectsBubblegum Feminized is the kind of strain that demonstrates how you donâ€™t need epic quantities of THC for an insanely epic experience. THC levels can occasionally creep as high as 19%, though in most instances range from 13% to 17%.After a couple of generous tokes, this herb gets to work on the brain with a feeling of moderate pressure and a slight spell of dizziness that quickly dissipates.

Rather than knocking you off your feet, youâ€™re instead treated to wave after wave of warm and electrifying tingles.Itâ€™s not unheard of for Bubblegum to be incapacitating when consumed in heavy quantities, but youâ€™d have to hit it pretty hard to end up horizontal.The general consensus would also seem to suggest that this marijuana is an absolute monster where the munchies are concerned, so itâ€™s advisable to keep a stockpile of snacks nearby.Medical Uses of Bubblegum FeminizedThis is a strain that has versatility and approachability written all over it. The combination of a perfectly balanced genetic composition and moderate THC content make Bubblegum Feminized just the thing for a wide variety of health complaints and conditions.For example, the energizing and uplifting properties are just the ticket for dealing with occasional bouts of anxiety, stress and depression.

Sheâ€™s more than capable of dealing with everyday aches and pains, along with occasional bouts of stiffness and mild to moderate headaches.Drowsiness is inevitable when the high reaches its climax, though not to such an extent as to knock you out entirely. Hence, Bubblegum Fem is a great strain to reach for when mild relief is called for - not necessarily when struggling with more advanced or chronic conditions.For the most part, this herb isnâ€™t THC-heavy enough to bring on bouts of paranoia or panic in the uninitiated. Though itâ€™s worth treading carefully in the early stages, as the initial cerebral uplift can be pretty hard-hitting.Growing Bubblegum Feminized SeedsAlong with being a fragrant, flavorful and fantastically enjoyable strain in general, Bubblegum Feminized is also an absolute gift to grow. Having been around since todayâ€™s more advanced grow gear was not even invented, this is a strain that doesn't need a great deal of TLC to get the job done.Yields can be maximized with carefully controlled conditions and balanced nutrient provision, but youâ€™ll still do well enough by simply throwing a few seeds in a pot of soil and riding it out.This is the feminized version of Bubblegum, so youâ€™ve no need to worry about problematic male plants. Flowering times vary from around 8 to 10 weeks, at which point youâ€™ll be looking at plants no taller than around 150cm.Outdoors, you should be looking to harvest around the middle of October, for yields that often reach 600g for every square meter of grow space. Indoors, a slightly more compact yield of around 400g for every square meter is the norm.Mature Bubblegum plants can be somewhat on the â€˜aromaticâ€™ side to say the least, so youâ€™ll want to consider odor-control measures if necessary. Other than this, the occasional trim is really all thatâ€™s needed to get the job done.SummaryAsk anyone who knows anything about good weed and theyâ€™ll tell you the same.

Seeds Supreme,https://seedsupreme.com/rainbow-glue-feminized-cannabis-seeds.html,Rainbow Glue Feminized Cannabis Seeds - Homegrown Cannabis Co.,"Rainbow Glue feminized seeds are the offspring of Gorilla Glue #4 and Zkittlez, where sticky meets sensual and pleasure reigns supreme. Youâ€™re looking at 22% THC, but the high feels like double that, especially if you draw out the Myrcene with a healthy grow.

Seeds Supreme,https://seedsupreme.com/skywalker-feminized.html,Skywalker,"Berry-Sweet Sativa for Soaring Cerebral EffectsBud BasicsAn unusual strain for many reasons, Skywalker Feminized is the Sativa-leaning hybrid result of breedingMazar, a famous landrace strainfrom the north of Afghanistan, and Blueberry, a highly-regarded, fruity Indica masterpiece.How and why their resultant love child tends more toward Sativa traits and effects is a mystery, but no one in the cannabis community could argue that this weed is anything short of delicious, dank and potent.As you can imagine, weâ€™re not looking too closely for an answer.Named Skywalker for reasons unknown, weâ€™ve decided that the profound buzz of this ganja is too similar to the sound of a lightsaber to ignore - but by all means, draw your own conclusions.What we can say for certain is this pot takes her deliciously fruity aroma from her Blueberry parentage, and when broken apart, the scent released by these buds is beyond comparison.Of course, this herbtruly shines when toked. Heavy on the uplifting cerebral highs, youâ€™ll find yourself humming with happiness when you light up a joint of this strain, before slowly slipping down to a deep and restful body-stone thatâ€™s calming and unmissable.Cultivating this cannabis is a simple and straightforward process. Though Skywalker Feminized thrives indoors where conditions can be controlled, sheâ€™ll grow well enough in most locations, in most substrates, and is hardy enough to withstand the weight of her own massive colas without any additional support from you.In fact, with feminized seeds to remove the worry of pollination, all youâ€™re responsible for is keeping her warm, dry and well-trimmed. And drying and curing those tasty nugs for a stash thatâ€™s all your own.Flavor and Fragrance of Skywalker FeminizedAlthough a hybrid strain, Skywalker Feminized borrows her taste and aroma from one side of the family more than the other and is abundant with the sweetness of berries and fruit much like her parent strain, Blueberry.The muskiness that underpins her scent is elevated once this herb is combusted, intensifying to hint at notes of pine and spice that linger on the taste buds.EffectsDespite Skywalker Femâ€™s Sativa leanings, sheâ€™s still capable of inducing a profound body-stone thatâ€™s more characteristic of an Indica genotype. As such, thishigh is best saved for the evening or any time youâ€™ve got a few hours to spare to chill.Beginning in the head with a mellow buzz, the onset of this weed is fast and starts to kick in with just a few tokes. Theintensity gradually increases until your mind is overwhelmed with euphoric sensations, positivity pushing out stress and worry as these buds workto lift your mood and free your mind.As you acclimatize to the cerebral effects of this weed, the body-stone kicks in, spreading a deeply physical sense of calm throughout your body and inspiring your most sloth-like qualities.Though unlikely to lead to couchlock in moderate doses, weâ€™d still suggest you clear your schedule of anything strenuous or active after a joint of this ganja. Seasoned smokers will handle this weed fairly well, but newbies might find themselves falling asleep fairly quickly.Still, there are always side effects to marijuana consumption - usually dry eyes and cottonmouth, which can be alleviated with plenty of hydration. In this case, higher doses can lead to headaches, dizziness, paranoia and increased anxiety, especially in novice smokers or those with a low tolerance to THC.Medical Uses of Skywalker FeminizedBlissful and euphoric, Skywalker Feminized is over-burdened with healing and therapeutic properties that can be incredibly useful as a medical strain. For patients in the medicinal marijuana (MMJ) community seeking relief and reprieve from psychological ailments, these buds areideal for uplifting the mind and ushering out intrusive negativity, particularly for those suffering from stress, anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder or PTSD.As a physical herb, the Indica side of this strain can function as an analgesic and anti-inflammatory and can alleviate the pain of such conditions as migraines, arthritis, muscle spasms and more.Like most marijuanastrains, Skywalker Fem can induce some serious hunger pangs with her munchies effect. Thiscan be beneficial to those suffering from lack of appetite as a side effect of eating disorders, chemotherapy or HIV/AIDS, due to the nausea-preventing anti-emetic properties of this weed.Deeply sedating, the tranquilizing and muscle-relaxing effects of this herb can be effective at sending even those with a high tolerance for THC to sleep, and as such can work wonders for those with insomnia seeking deep, restorative slumber.Growing Skywalker Feminized SeedsModerately sized marijuana, Skywalker Feminized can reach heights of around 90 centimeters when grown indoors, and stretch as far as 150 centimeters when grown al fresco. This meansthat her brawny branches are suitable for most properly equipped grow rooms.With lush and gorgeous foliage of broad, vivid green leaves, her sturdy limbs require no additional support as she grows, even as her colas get heavier as she matures. Thethick leafage of these plants does mean that some pruning is required to remove excess leaves and side branches, however, tooptimize light exposure and airflow.Skywalker Fem will thrive whether you choose to grow her in a hydroponics setup (for explosive growth) or in organic soil (to boost her terpene profile, and thereby her flavor and aroma). Either way, keep the temperature controlled at between 21Â° and 26Â°C, in a relatively dry environment.Since outdoor conditions are more difficult to control and prone to fluctuations, we recommend cultivating this cannabis indoors, as the management of this herbâ€™s climate is crucial, particularly during the 9 to 10 weeks in which sheâ€™s flowering.Additionally, indoor growers can more easily utilize a Sea of Green (SOG) setup, which can boost yields up to a considerable 400 grams per square meter and make better use of the available space.Should outdoor cultivation be your only viable option, then try to opt for warm and sunny climates such as the Mediterranean, California or Australia. In the northern hemisphere, these nugs are ready for harvesting around the middle of October, and you should find yourself with a tasty yield of around 500 grams per plant.SummarySmall and sturdy, Skywalker Feminized is a high-yielding strain bred from two deliciouslydivine Indicas, that somehow ended up being Sativa-heavy. Perfect for a nighttime strain, her dessert-like berry flavors hide a seriously potent 21% THC content thatâ€™s capable of providing soaring cerebral effects, clearing the mind, honing the focus and stoning the body right down to the couch.Heavy-hitting as she is, this marijuanamakes a great choice for the MMJ tokerswhen seeking an all-natural (and supremelytasty)alternative to traditionally prescribed medications. Painkilling, anti-inflammatory and ideal for psychological ailments such as stress and depression, the muscle relaxing and uplifting effects of this weed are not to be missed.For novice growers, this herb is an excellent choice to learn and develop the skills for more complex strains. Maintaining the environment is key, but with only a little experience, these beauties willthrive in most environments and fit the smaller grow rooms nicely. No trellising or support is required as these plants are strong enough to hold their own weight, and all-fem seeds remove the risk of pollination. Treat this hybrid well, and sheâ€™ll reward you with a copious yield of the fruitiest nugs for your very own.  Cannabis affects everyone differently.

Seeds Supreme,https://seedsupreme.com/amnesia-purple-feminized.html,Amnesia Purple,"Anything But ForgettableBud BasicsA consistently tricky strain to get hold of, Amnesia Purple is a beautifully colorful hybrid that leans heavily towards the Indica side of the scale - a fantastic strain for evening use when your calendar is pretty much clear.The exact origins of this mauve marijuana arenâ€™t clear, but what we do know is that this stuff often tests for a THC content of more than 20%.Thereâ€™s a very slight hint of Sativa to the effects, but not to such an extent as to dull or dilute any physical impact. Think a near-incapacitating body stone coupled with a gentle hint of euphoria and youâ€™re on the right tracks.All those whoâ€™ve tried this rare purple pot consistently report an exceptionally enjoyable, comfortable and uplifting experience. Uplifting in the all-round happiness sense - not in the energizing sense.If this wasnâ€™t enough, Amnesia Purple Feminized is a relatively simple strain to cultivate and consistently produces generous yields. She needs well balanced conditions to achieve her full potential, particularly where those pretty purple hues are concerned.As an added bonus, being the feminized version of this herb means problematic male plants are out of the equation entirely.Whether you bag yourself a batch of Amnesia Purple or a packet of seeds, consider yourself lucky - youâ€™re in for something extremely special!Flavor and Fragrance of Amnesia PurpleYouâ€™d normally expect a strain with these kinds of beautiful purple colors to be bursting with berry or grape fragrances. Amnesia Purple takes an interesting step away from the norm, releasing the most enchanting lemon-fresh aromas during the flowering stage.This citrus scent is even further intensified when the buds are broken, complemented by a wave of classic Skunk and exotic hash when combusted.The inhale is dominated by sweetly tropical and fresh fruits, with a wonderfully rich and satisfying smoke that lingers on the palate for hours. The aftertaste has more earth and Skunk to it, though with plenty of citric goodness to tantalize the tastebuds.Thereâ€™s nothing particularly harsh or challenging about the smoke, so coughing is usually out of the question. Vaping Amnesia Purple can be great for enjoying the subtler nuances, but the real effect of these hash-like undertones is best enjoyed by burning the buds.EffectsAmnesia Purple Feminized has a tendency to be potent and powerful, but doesn't hit so hard as to be overpowering or uncomfortable. Quite the opposite - this quintessential creeper takes her time, slowly working her way through the body with a feeling of warm electric tingles.For the first 30 minutes or so, youâ€™d be forgiven for thinking you were looking at a relatively modest Sativa. The first sensation is one of positivity, optimism and contentment, filling the brain with wave after wave of light but enjoyable euphoria.Worries are replaced with a dreamy sense of bliss, which is perfect for wiping out the blues of an otherwise crappy day.Soon, a heaviness begins to work its way into the limbs and a very mild sense of numbness floods the body. Couch-lock isnâ€™t out of the question, but doesn't hit so hard as to be shocking or paralyzing. Youâ€™re incapacitated, but you could still technically move if you absolutely had to.The feeling of mild euphoria perpetuates throughout the entire experience, paving the way for hour after hour of self-indulgence and enjoyment.Interestingly, some users with a low THC tolerance have cited Amnesia Purple as one to avoid if you suffer from panic attacks or paranoia. Though the vast majority of batches donâ€™t contain a particularly high THC content, so are probably fine if approached with caution. Just donâ€™t take things too far with those first few tokes.Medical Uses of Amnesia Purple FeminizedThe medical applications of Amnesia Purple fall primarily on the physical side of the spectrum.The initial uplift is more than sufficient to deal with mood disorders and everyday bouts of the blues, but itâ€™s more about the way this ganja gets to work on the body. As the high is something of a creeper, itâ€™s worth giving things 30 minutes (or even an hour) before topping up with a bigger dose.Mild to moderate aches and pains are no match for this Indica-heavy hybrid. The warm and slightly numbing body stone is great for getting to work on a variety of ailments, ranging from muscle pains to joint stiffness to migraines.This herbâ€™s also reputed to be a fantastic strain to hit after a heavy workout, perhaps even contributing to muscle repair and recovery (so they say).Sooner or later, the high lulls the user into a state of hopeless sleepiness, subsequently bringing on a period of long and undisturbed rest. All of which makes Amnesia Purple a fantastic strain for dealing with the occasional bout of insomnia, or when heavy thoughts are playing on your mind and making it difficult to get to sleep.Growing Amnesia Purple Feminized SeedsGenerally speaking, youâ€™ll find growing Amnesia Purple Feminized at home is a fairly simple and forgiving experience - and being a feminized variety, you donâ€™t have to worry about problematic male plants making an unwelcome appearance.This beauty is a resilient and resistant strain, meaning a comparatively low risk of mold, pest infestation, pathogens and the like.

Seeds Supreme,https://seedsupreme.com/cake-bomb-feminized.html,Cake Bomb,"Bud originCake Bomb originates from PCS1 and Do-Si-Dos feminized, providing its boastfully high THC levels of up to 30%. This strain earns its terpene profile and kerosene flavors from its OG lineage of Scotts OG and Casper OG (PCS1 parents).Cake Bomb cannabis seeds grow into 50/50 hybrid flowers. The indica genetics offer a sense of calmness and relaxation, while the sativa genetics bring an energizing, creative kick. These nugs are to die for with their best-of-both-worlds facets.This cultivar brings together tokers worldwide, eager for its cake-like aromas and punchy effects. Since the buds are super potent, we recommend taking it slow and stopping to smell the flowers.Growing feminized Cake Bomb seedsCake Bomb seeds are relatively tricky to grow but offer you the chance to expand your cultivation knowledge. This feminized strain delivers 99% female crops, preventing unwanted pollination during the growing process.The plants require a fair amount of maintenance and prefer low-stress training (LST) methods to keep the crop manageable. They can grow indoors and outside as long as the conditions are optimal.The main challenge comes from the plantsâ€™ height. Since they grow reasonably tall, their branches are susceptible to breaking. Build support structures to keep the crops from toppling over during flowering.Breeders recommend using training methods such as topping. Encourage horizontal growth instead of vertical to increase the yield and strengthen the stems and branches.Once you buy top-quality weed seeds from our store, your first step is to germinate them. Find a warm and dark place, and gather a few paper towels. Moisten the towels and place your seeds on them about an inch apart. Use a plate to keep everything safe and secure.After 1â€“5 days, you should see the seeds sprouting taproots. Once theyâ€™re a quarter-inch long, move the immature plants to your growing area of choice. We recommend using 5â€“10 gallon pots with efficient drainage holes and organic soil.Grow feminized Cake Bomb seeds in soil or using the hydroponics method. The roots have more access to nutrients when you suspend them in water, but soil is cheaper and easier to work with.What climate do these seeds prefer?Cake Bomb marijuana plants thrive in Mediterranean climates in the Northern Hemisphere. They grow efficiently with temperatures around 70â€“85Â°F. Once your crops start flowering, drop the temperatures to about 68â€“75Â°F for ideal results.Measure the temperature daily to ensure it doesnâ€™t drop below 50Â°F or reach over 85Â°F. Keep the humidity levels at 60â€“70% during the vegetative stage and 40â€“50% during the flowering phase.Outdoors, plant your seeds in April/May. Allow them to have ample space to grow and receive enough light. See that your plants have at least 12 hours of dark to encourage the flowering stage.Indoors, use blackout curtains to shade the plants. Since this strain is photoperiod, provide it with 18 hours of light during the vegetative stage. Change to a 12/12 light cycle during the flowering stage. Use 600-watt HPS lamps as the light source.Feeding Cake BombAdding nutrients may increase the quality of your nugs. Breeders recommend vitamin B supplements for healthy, vibrant flowers and efficient soil. Follow strict feeding schedules, ensuring perfect amounts of nutrients, water, and light.Opt for soil made with perlite, worm casting, or bat guano. Plant your seeds in this cannabis-specific soil, rich in nutrients such as sulfur and nitrogen.When the plant nears the end of the seedling phase, around 2â€“3 weeks, youâ€™ll notice strong, healthy leaves growing. From then on, add some calcium and magnesium for optimized buds. Continue until you see the small nugs flowering.Flowering & yieldsThese feminized Cake Bomb seeds grow into dense crops with medium yields. Indoors, you can expect 17â€“21 oz./mÂ², with 17â€“22 oz./plant outdoors. They typically grow to 4â€“5 feet. Harvest time is in mid-October outside and after the 8â€“10 week flowering time indoors.Stop all pruning and feeding schedules once the flowering stage is upon you. Increase the lighting and avoid stressing out the plant. Youâ€™ll soon notice sticky buds showing near the center of the plant, with the scent growing stronger as time passes.The buds produced have dark, rich green hues. They boast dazzling orange pistils and frosty-white trichomes.Experiencing the Cake Bomb strainCake Bomb inherits insanely high THC of 28â€“30% from its Do-Si-Dos mother strain.

Allow the artist inside to flourish with this strain as you ride the high.Along with mental relaxation, lean back into a soothing body high. Feel the tension in your limbs ease with an overwhelming sense of tranquility. Nowâ€™s the time to fully sit back and chill without doing strenuous activities.We recommend beginners take their time with Cake Bomb. The potency may be too much for some people to handle, so take small doses for efficient effects. Even if youâ€™re a seasoned toker, puff in moderation.You may run into minor adverse effects.

Seeds Supreme,https://seedsupreme.com/amnesia-feminized.html,Amnesia,"An All-Time Citrus-Spiked ClassicBud BasicsThe all-female version of the all-time classic, Amnesia is a strain that deserves your attention and appreciation.This iconic cannabis has lent her genetics to countless award-winning strains over the years, collectively picking up more than 20 major awards between them. Aside from all this, Amnesia Feminized is a fragrant, delicious and downright mind-blowing strain in her own right.Engineered by combining the genetics of Jack Herer, Cinderella 99 and Skunk #1, this herb perfectly concentrates all thatâ€™s fantastic about both of her parent strains. Uplifting, energizing and giggly in the extreme, Amnesia is for all those times youâ€™d prefer not to take life too seriously.That said, these buds can also be great for firing you up for a lousy afternoon at the office - if approached with extreme care and caution.Amnesia has been strutting her stuff for decades now, yet still gives even the most technologically sophisticated strains a run for their money. Sheâ€™s a predominantly Sativa strain with little to no discernible Indica effects, and a THC content that averages around the 19% mark.Take note though, itâ€™s not uncommon for these buds to pack as much as 25% THC - precisely why the above-mentioned care and caution is essential.One toke too many and youâ€™re looking at hysterical and uncontrollable giggles for the duration, coupled with equally hilarious short-term memory loss.Relatively easy to grow and of huge importance in medical cannabis circles, Amnesia Feminized is one of the most important cannabis strains ever to hit the commercial market. Buy a batch if the mood takes you, but thereâ€™s nothing quite as satisfying as growing something as old-school as this straight from the seed.Flavor and Fragrance of Amnesia FeminizedThe most prolific terpenes present in Amnesia are terpinolene, caryophyllene and myrcene - famed for their fruity, peppery and herbal aromas respectively.This herb is renowned for bearing the sweetest and sourest of citrus aromas, underpinned by spicy pepper and plenty of rich earthiness. Set fire to the buds and itâ€™s an entirely more herbal experience, though with even more tropical freshness on the nose and on the palate.Smoking Amnesia sets you up for a smooth and enjoyable experience thatâ€™s almost never cough-inducing. Some say the subtler nuances of the flavors are best enjoyed via low-temperature vaporization - others insist anything but smoking these buds the old-fashioned way is a crime against cannabis culture.In both instances, this hybrid is the classic wolf in sheepâ€™s clothing. Sweet, fruity and gentle on the airways, she gives no indication as to just how powerful the punch to follow will be.EffectsDepending on your THC tolerance, Amnesia can be an unbeatable strain for daytime use.With measured intake, these buds bring on wave after wave of creative and positive energy, providing you with the motivation and focus needed to get things done. Artistic types rave about the inspired and â€˜out of the boxâ€™ thinking Amnesia triggers, along with the herbâ€™s capacity to obliterate pessimism and negative thoughts from the equation.Long story short - the perfect strain for reversing everything that sucks about a Monday morning (when dosed in moderation). All with the bonus of no discernible Indica heaviness creeping into the equation.The only (possible) downside is that one toke too many and youâ€™re a giggling wreck for hours on end. If this is your intention, Amnesia is unbeatable as a laughter-inducing strain. One thatâ€™s also associated with remarkably effective bouts of short-term memory loss, which add even further hilarity to the festivities. Nevertheless, take things too far in a more formal environment andâ€¦ well, you can probably figure out the rest for yourself.Start out slow with Amnesia Feminized to see how you react to her, rather than blasting yourself into oblivion at the worst possible time.Medical Uses of Amnesia FeminizedTodayâ€™s medical marijuana market simply wouldnâ€™t be the same without Amnesia. This high-energy Sativa strain has lent her genetics to dozens of popular hybrids over the years, subsequently making their way into millions of medicine cabinets.The medical applications of Amnesia are somewhat one-dimensional, but this is far from a bad thing - it simply means you know exactly what youâ€™re getting.100% cerebral in nature, this herbâ€™s effects are ideal for treating all types of mood disorders and depression. Even where stress, anxiety and everyday upset are relatively severe, a few careful tokes and youâ€™re right as rain.The high is also known to linger for hours on end, meaning you donâ€™t need a great deal to have the desired effect.Lethargy, chronic tiredness and periods of poor motivation can also be immediately remedied with Amnesia Fem. As can feelings of poor self-esteem and issues with social anxiety - no match for a few careful hits of these buds. If youâ€™re simply looking to remove the dark cloud thatâ€™s been following you around, this stuff is your silver lining.As mentioned above, just be sure to start out slowly as the soaring cerebral uplift can be overpowering and disconcerting for some.Growing Amnesia Feminized SeedsThis is the feminized version of Amnesia, meaning no problematic male plants to worry about.This strain has a relatively extensive flowering time of around 80 days, though patience is rewarded with yields of up to 500g of quality cannabis for every square meter of grow space. All with a potential THC of up to 25%, if you play your cards right.Give your plants sufficient vertical space and theyâ€™ll reach around 1.8 meters in height, rarely requiring any physical support to handle their own weight.Warm Mediterranean-like temperatures work best, but Amnesia Feminized nonetheless has the resilience to deal with the occasional cold snap. Hence, sheâ€™s a relatively simple strain to grow, even if you donâ€™t have a great deal of experience.SummaryThe importance of Amnesia alone makes this herb an all-time classic you simply must experience. Likewise, the fact that these genetics have paved the way for dozens of award-winning strains over the years speaks for itself.Whichever way you look at it, you simply cannot consider yourself a cannabis connoisseur without a stockpile of these nugs in your stash box. Even if youâ€™re more into her offspring than the original, a tip of the hat is well deserved to this all-time classic.Particularly when you consider that half the strains youâ€™ve been enjoying as of late may not have existed at all, had it not been for the original Amnesia.

When in reality, all you get is the ultimate organic tranquilizer.Famed in recreational and therapeutic cannabis circles alike for her near-narcotic effects, Bubba Kush is as good as it gets where guaranteed couch-lock is concerned.Leaning strongly towards the Indica side of the scale - 70% Indica to 30% Sativa - youâ€™d actually be forgiven for thinking this stuff was a pure Indica strain. Likewise, the moderate average THC content of 15% to 20% belies the power of this potâ€™s punch.Bubba Kush has been around for quite some time, though the strainâ€™s exact origins remain something of a mystery. Though itâ€™s widely speculated that Bubba Kush has OG Kush in her direct ancestry - one of the most celebrated and important strains of all time.Powerful, pungent and perfect for periods of pure indulgence, Bubba Kush Auto is a predominantly therapeutic strain with a potent effect. Sheâ€™s also a gorgeously aromatic strain with a unique fragrance and flavor profile, which differentiates the herb from pretty much anything else out there.Flavor and Fragrance of Bubba Kush AutoflowerAsk anyone who knows what Bubba Kush smells of and theyâ€™ll give you a single straight answer - coffee.When these buds are grown and cured properly, they produce the most enticing and inviting coffee-like fragrance, often underpinned with notes of rich dark chocolate. Thereâ€™s also a fair amount of exotic hashish and a hint of spice on the nose - all of which explodes in ferocity and complexity when the buds are broken.The flavor profile brings its hash-like qualities to the forefront, with plenty of earthiness and peppery spice. The coffee and chocolate flavors linger beautifully on the palate, which some have said are complemented with a hint of hazelnut.Sweet, decadent and supremely satisfying, Bubba Kush produces a dense yet manageable smoke that rarely induces coughing.This hybrid doesn't have that quintessential â€˜cannabis stinkâ€™ in its raw form, therefore isnâ€™t quite as difficult to keep under wraps as some comparable strains. By contrast, set light to the nugs and everything in the vicinity ends up stinking to high heaven.EffectsThis is a strain that hits almost like a pure Indica, though isnâ€™t to be misinterpreted as one-dimensional. Bubba Kush Auto is unique in that she pairs a completely incapacitating body stone with a sense of blissful contentment and clarity.Rather than being melted into a puddle of pure pathetic mess for the duration, youâ€™re lulled into a state of blissful enjoyment and satisfaction with the world around you.Of course, the primary effect is one of fast-acting and overwhelming sedation. After just a few hits, you can expect to sink into and subsequently become glued to the nearest couch or armchair. This herb brings on a near-instant feeling of physical heaviness and numbness that makes it borderline impossible to remain mobile. If a prolonged bout of couchlock is what youâ€™re after, this stuff tops the table.Though again, Bubba Kush gets to work with near-narcotic effectiveness without any of the usual mind-fog.Youâ€™ll remain clearheaded enough to maintain a coherent conversation, enjoying bursts of inspiration and creativity throughout the experience.Rather than blasting your brain into oblivion, this cannabis can actually be quite thought provoking. Giggles arenâ€™t out of the equation, either, though youâ€™ll probably be too lazy to perform such an exertion.Give it a while and the only thing youâ€™ll be thinking about is how much food you can stuff down your throat in the fastest possible time. By a considerable margin, this strain is one of the most notorious on the market for bringing on insatiable cases of the munchies.Medical Uses of Bubba Kush AutoflowerFor the most part, the medical benefits of Bubba Kush lean towards the physical side of the equation.This stuff has become a go-to strain for medical cannabis patients seeking relief from a wide variety of chronic pain conditions, along with muscle spasms, joint stiffness, arthritis and so on.The way in which Bubba Kush Auto gets to work with a numbing effect on the body makes this one of the most effective strains on the market for pain relief.Of course, the fact that this pot pretty much guarantees an excellent nightâ€™s sleep also makes it great for tackling the occasional bout of insomnia. All without the next-day drowsiness youâ€™d associate with prescription meds and OTC sleeping pills.The moderate Sativa makeup of Bubba Kush also has its therapeutic applications, replacing negative thoughts and bad moods with a feeling of confidence and contentment. These buds arenâ€™t going to propel you into a state of pure euphoria, but can be just the thing for putting a lousy day at the office behind you.When it comes to appetite restoration, this herbâ€™s hard to beat, as prolonged cases of the munchies are inevitable with this stuff.As Bubba Kush Autoflower is almost always incapacitating, sheâ€™s a strain that should be approached with caution by anyone with a low THC tolerance. Likewise, if you have a history of panic attacks or paranoia, this one could be a strain to avoid entirely.Growing Bubba Kush Autoflower SeedsThis is the autoflowering version of Bubba Kush, so no need to worry about light/dark cycles. When the time is right, your plants will automatically switch to the flowering stage and begin producing bountiful buds.From start to finish, this is an exceptionally easy strain to grow, with plants that rarely reach higher than around 1m or so. Warm Mediterranean-like conditions are needed to grow Bubba Kush Autoflower outdoors, so your plants are best kept indoors in cooler northern climates.Flowering times average around eight weeks, after which youâ€™ll be looking at an average of 17oz of quality weed for every square meter of grow space.One of the benefits of growing Bubba Kush Auto is that the plants donâ€™t have a particularly characteristic â€˜skunkyâ€™ stink in their raw form, so arenâ€™t quite as difficult as some of their counterparts to keep under wraps. Odor control will be necessary if discretion is a priority, but these beauties certainly donâ€™t stink like some specimens.With her naturally elevated resistance to pest infestation, mold, bud rot and common plant diseases, Bubba Kush Autoflower practically grows herself with just a little careful supervision.SummaryBubba Kush is a surprisingly versatile strain, which combines the raw power and punch of a pure Indica with the clear-headedness of a quality Sativa. Though not what youâ€™d call a recreational cannabis strain in the traditional sense, this herb can nonetheless be perfect for afternoons and evenings of pure indulgence.Well-cultivated Bubba Kush Auto plants produce relatively moderate yields, though itâ€™s worth remembering that a little of this stuff goes a very long way.Particularly when consumed in the form of edibles, these buds deliver the kind of punch that can be inebriating in the extreme. Novice smokers are advised to approach Bubba Kush with extreme caution, though seasoned stoners will be in their element with this stuff.When the mood takes you and the only thing you have on your mind is a bout of pure and unadulterated laziness, look no further than this herb.  Cannabis affects everyone differently. Your experience with this strain may not be the same as someone elseâ€™s. Growing conditionsâ€”including light, nutrients, and pot sizeâ€”play a major role in shaping the plantâ€™s yield, potency, and flavor profile. Results will always vary based on how and where itâ€™s grown.",2206,

Seeds Supreme,https://seedsupreme.com/master-kush-feminized.html,Master Kush,"A Marijuana Master at the Art of RelaxationBud BasicsMaster Kush Feminized (also known as Grandmaster Kush and High Rise) has been around for a long while now, first debuting in the Netherlands in the 90s, and has grown into her name wonderfully.A master of flavor and relaxation, itâ€™s no surprise that this herb's got a host of awards tucked into her belt, receiving the seal of approval from Snoop Dogg himself alongside the famedCannabis Cup - not once, not twice, but three times.Bred into existence from two already iconic strains, Master Kush combines the elite Indica genetics of Hindu Kush with the celebrated skunky perfection that is Skunk #1. With extensie landrace heritage on both sides, expectations for this marijuana master were understandably high - but she certainly lives up to her legacy, providing what some would call the perfect relaxing high with a dank and well-loved earthy fuel fragrance.Smoothly softening perceptions and easing the mind into a haze of bliss, this weed swiftly calms, soothes and eases you from the inside out, filling you with warm, fuzzy feelings of contentment. Itâ€™s this marvelous ability that makes medicinal tokers swoon, since itâ€™s hard to hold onto stress, anxiety or even pain when youâ€™re at the Master Kush level of relaxation.Itâ€™s true, this herb isnâ€™t the easiest to grow - but sheâ€™s by far not the hardest, either. All those landrace genetics combine to make her sturdy and fairly resilient, but the sheer density of her nugs and branches require a little trimming. Still, her yields are higher than average, and for a high this fine, sheâ€™s worth it.Flavor and Fragrance of Master Kush FeminizedOne of the most well-known and well-loved aromas in the cannabis community, Master Kush Feminized is instantly recognizable due to her dank and earthy scent. Strong and complex, notes of diesel and pine make-up much of her fragrance, set off by the spicy hint of crushed pepper and the faintest hint of citrus, well-hidden by her pungency.EffectsRelaxation is something of an art form - and youâ€™ve guessed it, Master Kush is a master at it. It doesnâ€™t take long for the mood to chill when you take a few tokes of this ganja, and in no time at all your head will be in the clouds, and youâ€™ll have fully embraced tranquility - though some tokers report an increase in intellectual curiosity.Though the physical side of this stone takes a little longer to kick in, the psychoactive side of Master Kush Fem will set in swiftly and smoothly with a cerebral kick that softens perceptions, elevates mood and soon has you on the path to embracing inner peace. This unfocusing euphoria will muddle the mind for a while, erasing stress with a carefree attitude before the body-stone begins.Loosening limbs and releasing muscles from tension, the calming sensations of this high will ease and soothe you from top to toe, outwards and inwards, as you're pulled down into near-couchlock (or at least deeply into the sofa cushions).Soon, sleep will begin to seem like the most wonderful idea in the world and your eyelids will leaden as you finally drift off.22% THC content isnâ€™t a number to be trifled with, and Master Kush might seem super chill, but can be potent and uncomfortable for beginners. Too much of this pot will go well beyond the usual cottonmouth and dry eyes, and you may find yourself dizzy, or with increased paranoia. A few reports seem to suggest that this is more likely when this weed is consumed as an edible.Medical Uses of Master Kush FeminizedBy utilizing her high THC and various cannabinoids, Master Kush Feminized acts as an anxiolytic to unburden the body and mind, inducing feelings of relaxation and euphoria that elevate mood and temporarily provide relief from psychological disorders such as stress, anxiety, depression and even mild PTSD.These same properties are both therapeutic and effective at treating a variety of painful and uncomfortable physical ailments.Abundant with pain-killing qualities, Master Kush can halt cramps, muscle spasms and arthritis in their tracks - at least for a little while. And if her analgesic compounds arenâ€™t quite cutting it, the drowsy, narcotic-like buzz these buds providewill benefit more than just those with insomnia, sending you off to dreamland for restful, restorative sleep.Growing Master Kush Feminized SeedsNot quite the easiest strain, but not the most complex either, youâ€™ll require at least some reasonable experience to truly manage Master Kush Feminized and allow her to thrive. Lucky for you, she already has a few traits that make her a pleasant plant to cultivate.Due to the Hindu Kush influence of her genetics, this herb is highly resistant to rot and mold, and wonâ€™t grow big enough to cause issues. At the most, sheâ€™ll reach around 2.5 feet, and sheâ€™s a sturdy specimen with a robust structure of short, chunky branches. Sound unappealing? Well actually, sheâ€™s quite the attention grabbing little beauty, glorious in shades of orange, red and yellow that alter like fall leaves as she matures.Though her compact, dense foliage is fairly resilient already, weâ€™d still recommend regular pruning in order to encourage better exposure to light, airflow through the branches and the best possible nutrition uptake (sheâ€™s strong-rotted, so constant fertilization is a must). Thankfully, since these all female seeds donâ€™t have hermaphroditic tendencies, this stress wonâ€™t cause any problems.Since this plant has a short growth cycle, if you were considering a Sea of Green (SoG) setup, weâ€™d nod enthusiastically. Itâ€™s the best way to maximize yield in a strain like this, so weâ€™d recommend a minimum of four plants to really boost your harvest.Once sheâ€™s fully grown, Master Kush Femâ€™s colas will be heavily laden with snowy, crystal coated buds, and if youâ€™ve grown her in organic soil you can expect her terpene profile to be just as enticing.She should flower for around 7 to 9 weeks, and once youâ€™re ready to reap, will produce around 1.31 ounces of nugs per square foot.Outdoor growers should note that this weed, like many, loves a warm, dry climate. You might find she flourishes more in the outdoors, but sheâ€™ll still need to be harvested by no later than September or October to avoid damage from the colder seasons. Outside, each plant is likely to leave you with around 17.6 ounces of sticky buds to stash.SummaryHer aroma evoking her Hindu Kush heritage, this earthen, peppery herb takes relaxation to another level - andMaster Kush Feminized can surprise and sedate even veteran smokers with her heavy body-stone and hazy mental high.As much a master of medicine as she is of relaxation, Master Kush can numb the mind and the body, easing anxiety and stress while wiping away the agonies of arthritis and cramps with her high THC potency.Short and stocky, this specimen can be cultivated in most indoor environments - though itâ€™s worth noting that outdoor growers have found she can produce great yields outdoors. Regardless of your choice, sheâ€™ll take a little support and love to keep her from collapsing, but all-fem seeds lessen the work, and a little experience may be enough if youâ€™re truly dedicated to the high that follows the harvest.  Cannabis affects everyone differently. Your experience with this strain may not be the same as someone elseâ€™s. Growing conditionsâ€”including light, nutrients, and pot sizeâ€”play a major role in shaping the plantâ€™s yield, potency, and flavor profile.

Stocky she may be, butKillerrequires plenty of pruning to ensure optimal airflow and light are maintained. Still, her hefty yield is worth waiting for.Flavor and Fragrance of Killer FeminizedThe first thing youâ€™ll notice when picking apart the buds ofKiller Fem, is just how pungent this stuff really is. Blending together the scent of pine and damp earth, this aroma is strong and tantalizing even before lighting up.Once combusted, the smoke of this cannabis tastes quite different - underpinning the soil notes of her scent arenotes of subtle, floral sweetness- much like nectar - accentuated with a hint of citrus lemon as you exhale.EffectsKillerby name and killer by nature, this strain can provide quite a kick, even for seasoned smokers.

Her analgesic properties, combined with her anti-inflammatory properties, make this stuff the ideal therapeutic pot for pain from both injury and disease.The physical effects of this strain also make these nugs a wonderful relief for those struggling with insomnia, since a few tokes ofKillerwill gently lower you down into a deep and restful sleep.Growing Killer Feminized SeedsSinceKiller Feminizedis Indica-leaning, sheâ€™s a fairly dense and stocky specimen - but donâ€™t take this to mean sheâ€™s as hardy as she looks. These plants are branchy, which means their structure naturally inhibits the light and airflow the plants receives - so growers need to remember to prune this cannabis often to avoid killing off the lower nodes. Plus, cutting away her dead parts means more nutrients for the rest of the plant.Asa fairly sensitive strain, youâ€™ll need to provide a stable and easily controlled environment forKiller, so weâ€™d recommend ahydroponicssetup or organic soil as the best mediums. If you wish to maximize space, mix either of these with aSea of Green(SoG) setup, with multiple plants growing simultaneously, and you can expect a hefty increase in the final yield.Be sure to give this ganja a decent amount of light, too - 600 to 100 watts from an HPS/LED grow lamp is ideal, and after 9 to 10 weeks of flowering, youâ€™ll have a healthy harvest of around 450 grams per square meter. Outdoors, you can harvest around October, and that yield can go up to 800 grams of dank buds per plant.With all-fem seeds, the chances of a male appearing in your crop are fairly slim. Once fully matured,Killer Femis a stunning specimen of dense, pinecone-shaped buds. Scattered with amber pistils (hairs) and a thick layer of resin, you can practically see the potency of this strain just from looking at her.SummaryDank and potent,Killer Feminizedis no strain for newbies, be that smokers or growers - either way, proceed with caution.An Indica-dominant hybrid, a few tokes of this stuff will provide you witha super relaxed highthat has your head out beyond the clouds, beyond the solar system and off in another galaxy - maybe thatâ€™s why sheâ€™s been nicknamedSkywalker.As pungent as she is potent,Killerhas a scent like damp earth and a flavor that evokes floral notes and a hint of lemon. This tempering of her strong scent makes her a mighty marijuana offering for medicinal consumers who arenâ€™t after her recreational benefits (since sheâ€™s also abundant with analgesic properties due to her high THC content, and an excellent choice for pain relief from injury and disease).GrowingKiller Femcan be a killer battle, as sheâ€™s not as hardy as she looks, and needs good light, temperatures, and plenty of pruning - but for those growers with green thumbs, sheâ€™s worth the effort, since those yields are as high as youâ€™ll be once these buds are dried, cured and rolled up to enjoy.  Cannabis affects everyone differently. Your experience with this strain may not be the same as someone elseâ€™s. Growing conditionsâ€”including light, nutrients, and pot sizeâ€”play a major role in shaping the plantâ€™s yield, potency, and flavor profile.

Of course, this means jaw-dropping yields are on the cards, but it also means youâ€™ll want to keep an eye onairflow and light penetrationto make sure even the lowest regions of the plant are well treated.Indoor grows are a particularly effective way of cultivatingCritical Jackas youâ€™ll have maximum control over the environment, but this can present more challenges like how on earth youâ€™ll ever make room for such gargantuan ganja plants.Growers opting for indoor cultivation should absolutely look to theScreen of Green(ScROG) technique for the answer to this while maintaining maximum output potential. You can also utilize some moreHigh Stress Training(HST) techniques like topping, or tricks like using smaller pots and reducing the plantsâ€™ vegetative period to help keepCritical Jack Feminizedcrops in check.Thankfully, this hybrid has an impressive resilience to mold, disease or pest problems, which means that other than giving your crop a suitable home and a little TLC, you wonâ€™t have much else to concern yourself with.Keep in mind, however, that the height and the pungent aroma of theseSkunk-infused beauties means discretion is not the easiest of achievements when growing a crop ofCritical Jack.

Seeds Supreme,https://seedsupreme.com/gelato-feminized.html,Gelato,"Our Lady of Taste and EuphoriaBud BasicsA strain apart from her peers,Gelato Feminizedstands in a league of her own for taste and experience before you even begin digging into her background - but her lineage holds pretty high bragging rights.Amongst the many hybrids that have grown increasingly more popular in the last few years, few can compare to the ancestors ofGelato- bred from parent strainsThin Mint CookieandSunset Sherbet, she also shares genetics with classics such asCherry Pie,Durban PoisonandOG Kush.Since her direct parentage combines a complex terpene profile of berries, candy and citrus with skunk notes with a particularly beautiful purple and blue phenotype of GSC,Gelato Femwas always going to be a looker and a keeper.Blending genetics well known for their heavy-hitting body highs, this fruity hybridis as you might expect - a euphoric surge followed by a full on, couch-locked stone.Perfect for recreation and a variety of medicinal uses, sheâ€™s a simple strain to grow, too - with all-fem seeds, you can expect a healthy yield with minimum effort as you cultivate.Flavor and Fragrance of GelatoItâ€™s not possible to have such deliciously tasty ancestry and not inherit those genes - and as you might expect,Gelatois no exception. Sheâ€™s a complex blend of exoticisms, combining berries, sherbet and an orange citrus tang with the earthier tastes of lavender and mint to create an incomparable flavor profile.But the delicacies donâ€™t end there - exhaling will bring yet more flavors to the table, filling the mouth with a sweet (one might say, cookie-esque), piney aftertaste.SinceGelato Feminizedcan be a particularly pungent strain when properly cured, sheâ€™s not particularly discreet. Though her smoke is interspersed with doughy, yeasty notes and is lung-expanding and smooth, we recommended taking precautions if youâ€™re intending to enjoy her outdoors.EffectsSome strains are strong, some strains are tasty.Gelatois both. Despite the facade of sweetness and innocence associated with her name, with a THC level that hovers around 25%, sheâ€™s a hit of satisfaction - but be wary not to overdo it. Recommended for seasoned consumers, this Cali hybridisnâ€™t known to be gentle on beginners.The fast acting euphoric buzz that comes with a toke ofGelato Feminizedmight be compared to a sugar rush - but that would be underselling her delights. A mentally stimulating strain, expect to find your head ventilated and clear - ready for action, should you so choose.In the early stages of thehigh, consumers tend to experience happiness and motivation most often, but though some might use her as a kick start in the morning, we wouldnâ€™t recommend it given what followsâ€¦As the cerebral high sets in, a smooth, soothing sensation will begin to spread through your body, relaxing you from head to toe as limbs become leaden and tension seeps away. At around this time, that earlier motivation will dissipate, and youâ€™re likely to find laziness creeping in to take its place.As previously stated, an experience withGelatois not for newbies, and can be intense even for veteran consumers, combining a sociable cheeriness with a buzzing head high. But this can soon turn inward into a more isolated, introspective high once the accompanying physical effects take hold, and couch-lock is more than likely in most who smoke a joint of this lady.Still, sheâ€™s not without side effects, and like many strains you might find yourself with red, dry eyes, cottonmouth or dizziness if you donâ€™t stay hydrated when enjoying these marijuana delights. Headaches, some anxiety and paranoia are also a possibility if you consume her in higher doses.Medical Uses of Gelato FeminizedAside from the recreational uses ofGelato Feminized, she also embodies many of the medical talents of her genetic lineage. As such, sheâ€™s potentially a godsend for a variety of ailments when considering that somewhere in her ancestry is the legendary landraceDurban Poison- one of the best medical strains ever grown.Gelatocan be used with great success as a natural painkiller, for the temporary relief of symptoms of arthritis, managing migraines orchronic pain.Given the uplifting high that comes with a toke or two of this stuff,you might expect that stresses would melt away as theyâ€™re replaced by a euphoric buzz that clears the mind. However, some studies have also shown that this bud beauty can be used to treat the symptoms of anxiety, due to the presence ofanxiolyticproperties.Appetite stimulation is yet another medicinal benefit of a joint of this ganja gem, as extreme cases of the munchies are a side effect of her psychoactive delights. As such, sheâ€™s popular with those managing eating disorders or those suffering from lack of appetite as a side effect of medication or chemotherapy, particularly as this strain may relieve feelings of nausea and sickness.Growing Gelato FeminizedOnce upon a time,Gelatohad something of a reputation for being difficult to grow - but no more. With feminized seeds, what once required a deal of time and energy is now simple to cultivate with only a basic level of expertise, and with a stable, all female crop assured, thereâ€™s no stopping you.GrowingGelato Femin organic soil is a classic choice, as itâ€™s known for bringing out the very best terpene profile in her, which is a surefire way to produce a gorgeously aromatic plant. Despite this, many growers still prefer to usehydroponicswith these ladies, as by ensuring that the plants receive all the required nutrients, you can be assured of an explosive growth period later, and a higher yield. Do make sure to provide the plants with 600 watts of LED/HPS, too.The Sea of Green (SOG) method is an ever-popular and effective approach to Gelato Feminized, which can also withstand bothLST(Low Stress Training) andHST(High Stress Training).If youâ€™re looking to create a little bag appeal, exposing the plants to lower temperatures during the dark cycle (before flowering starts) will nicely stimulate the production of anthocyanin pigments - and youâ€™ve guessed it, this will bring out the beautiful mauves and purples that make for such a stunning plant.Gelatois ever a stinky sort of strain, and once her flowers begin to mature sheâ€™ll get particularly pungent - odor control measures are highly recommended if youâ€™re growing indoors, as youâ€™ll struggle to grow the plants discreetly otherwise.In 8 to 9 weeks, you can expectGelato Feminizedâ€™s buds to fully develop, provided that youâ€™re using a 12/12 light cycle. This should leave you with a comfortable yield of between 1.6 to 1.9 ounces per square foot.Since shecan also thrive outdoors, it should be noted that a warm and humid environment is ideal if this is your preferred growing method. When harvested around mid-October, you can expect around 21 ounces of buds per plant - nice!SummaryAfter years of development and breeding between some of the very best strains available, itâ€™s no wonder thatGelato Feminizedemerged as a top contender at the end of it all. Sheâ€™s got bags of fruity flavor, smooth creamy smoke and levels of THC that canâ€™t be argued with - and she can be yours too.Easy to grow with all-fem seeds, you can expect to enjoy a decent yield in just 8 to 9 weeks with minimum effort - and one tokewill leave you floating on a cerebral high, wrapped in a blanket of warm, body-buzzing intensity in no time at all.Perfect for an evening socializing, a solo afternoon of introspection, or for alleviating symptoms of a variety of physical and mental ailments, sheâ€™s the strain for any veteran consumer who wants to try something that will tickle their taste buds whilst expanding their mind.

However, beginner growers should not necessarily shy away. After all, when there is a will there is a way!Bud BasicsThe buds on these bad boys can grow up to be dense and covered in frosty trichomes - that high THC content has to come from somewhere! Although usually pretty dark green, they have a white tint to them that makes them look juicy and enticing upon first sight.The scent of these flowers has a nice mix of earthy, sweet, and fruity notes. This is due, in large part, to their genetic lineage which has similar aromas to them. The flavor of the smoke also follows suit. Upon the exhale, you might notice a little bit more of the fruity aspect to the smoke than you will on the inhale.As mentioned, the effects of this strain are powerful. Therefore, this is a great option for experienced users rather than new ones. We find that the effects can produce a full-body high and a massive rush of euphoria on the come-up. It is also great for receiving some medical benefits to help with issues like stress, anxiety, chronic pain, and more.Moby x Do-Si-Dos Feminized SeedsIt is usually pretty straightforward to grow this strain, but we donâ€™t recommend this for new growers, as it isnâ€™t quite as resilient as some of the other strains in our catalog. However, expert growers who really know what they are doing have reported yields of over 20 ounces per plant! Of course, this has a lot to do with their growing techniques.To best have a shot at mimicking such results, we recommend keeping a stable temperature between 70-80Â°F. In addition, having some stakes or trellises can help support the branches, as the heavy buds can cause them to bend or break. We recommend using cannabis nutrients, regular pruning, and growing this as organically as possible to achieve the most impressive results possible.   Cannabis affects everyone differently.

Earthy skunkiness dominates the flavor profile, with just a hint of citrus and a slightly bitter undertone thatâ€™s far from unpleasant.EffectsItâ€™s becoming the norm to underestimate strains like this with a moderate THC content.

More often than not, medical weed users arenâ€™t out to blast themselves into kingdom come, simply for the sake of it.

This also reduces the amount of time needed to collect your haul â€“ just 10 weeks or so from seed to harvest being all it takes. Yields may be relatively moderate at around 2oz per plant, but itâ€™s still a decent result for such a fast and easy-to-grow specimen.Summary An outstanding new-generation hybrid with endless points of appeal, White Widow x California Snow Autoflower is everything a simple homegrown strain should be. Typically taking just 10 weeks to progress from seed to harvest, she's a compact and resilient specimen that averages around 15% THC.Along with being an exceptional session smoke, this herbhas a long list of therapeutic applications.

Sheâ€™s a plant thatâ€™s simple enough for beginners looking to develop their skills, and experienced growers will love how hassle-free this herb is.Since this version of the plant is autoflowering, sheâ€™s even more straightforward and quick growing than her parents, and resistant to more pests, mold and common diseases that target cannabis plants.Her branches are even and tubular, and sheâ€™s considerably taller than many other auto strains, with a top end height of 150 centimeters. As such, sheâ€™s a higher yielder than other autos too, with huge nugs that are densely coated in a blanket of glittering trichomes. These buds are particularly pungent and turn a gorgeous shade of purple towards the end of their flowering period.Indoors, Northern Lights x Big Bud Auto will probably reach about 130 centimeters in her short life cycle, which in total is between 11 and 13 weeks from germination to harvest.Grow these plants ina hydroponics setup and utilize the Sea of Green (SOG) setup before she starts flowering (at around 7 or 8 weeks) to really maximize your harvests. In a controlled environment kept at optimum temperatures and humidity, these beauties should yield around 600 grams of nugs per square meter.Choose to rear this lady out of doors, then opt for a sunny, Meditteranean climate or similar. In the northern hemisphere, you can start to plant these autoflowering seeds as soon as the last of the winter frost has gone, and weâ€™d recommend sowing another batch as the first begins to flower to harvest her twice a year.Final harvests should be no later than October, and in ideal conditions you should find yourself with up to 100 grams of resinous buds per plant.SummaryLegendary parents make for a legendary hybrid cross with Northern Lights x Big Bud Autoflower, and living up to expectations is a breeze for these buds. A sensory delight in aroma and fruity flavors, this herb's deliciousness is only the beginning as a few tokes will push you to the couch and glue you there even as your mind is shot into the northern lights themselves, to dance with bliss.If youâ€™re less a casual toker and more looking for medicinal value in a strain, then this weed will work for you too. A potent pain-reliever, this pot can provide relief for psychological symptoms by negating negativity and improving mood before lulling you to sleep.Growers will love this sturdy strain, and Northern Lights x Big Bud is as undemanding as it gets - resilient and resistant to molds and pests, sheâ€™ll require very little of your attention to flower as required and leave you hauling in the hefty (for an auto) harvests.

Though somehow, sheâ€™s not the kind of strain that takes you off-guard and knocks you off your feet â€“ even if your THC tolerance isnâ€™t huge.Flavor and Fragrance of Blue DreamThe fresh and fruity blueberry aromas this stuff puts out upon reaching maturity are simply mind-blowing. Cure your buds properly and the whole thing is intensified, combining bucket loads of sweet berry and grape fragrances with just the right amount of skunky goodness in the background.Incidentally, the most prolific terpenes in the average batch ofBlue Dreamare myrcene, pinene and caryophyllene respectively.Hard-hitting and pungent in the extreme, this isnâ€™t a particularly easy strain to keep under wraps. That said, she also doesnâ€™t have what you would call a quintessentially identifiable cannabis fragrance.Blue Dreamstinks to high heaven, but is muchmore fruity than funky.Itâ€™s a similar story with the flavor profile, which from top to bottom is dominated by masses of sweet berries and ripe fruits. When the buds are burned, a sharp citrus flavor is also released, complemented by a curious yet enjoyable hint of rich sandalwood. On the exhale,Blue Dream Feminizedleaves behind an aftertaste that harks of everything herBlueberryandHazeparents are famous for.By a considerable margin, this is one of the most decadently delicious strains ever to hit the commercial cannabis market. Precisely whyBlue Dreamis so popular among those who arenâ€™t particularly enamored with the usual skunk and funk of old-school weed.EffectsBlue Dream Feminizedmanages to make you feeluplifted and energized, yet relaxed and content at the same time. You feel creative and motivated to get things done, but at the same time donâ€™t have a care in the world. Youâ€™re filled with the energy you need to face whatever comes your way, but couldnâ€™t care less about whatâ€™s happening around you in general.In any case, all of the above adds up to one of the most fantastic daytime smokes money can buy, which is also outstanding for an enjoyable wake and bake. Precisely why millions now replace their afternoon coffee with a couple ofBlue Dreamhits, helping them power through the day without a care in the world.Probably the only thing this blueberry beautycannotdo is lull you into a good nightâ€™s sleep.

This being the feminized version, you also benefit from the (almost) guarantee of nothing but healthy female plants.Stick with a controlled indoor grow space if the conditions outdoors arenâ€™t particularly stable, providing regular doses of nutrients for improved yields.Flowering times come in at around nine weeks, after which itâ€™s possible to harvest as much as 600g of potent weed for every square meter of grow space.If things seem to be progressing painfully slowly at first, be patient.Blue Dreamis notorious for taking a while to get going, only to then go into overdrive as she approaches the flowering stage. The potent fragrance these plants emit as they approach maturity is difficult to keep under wraps, so you may need to consider your odor control system.True to her name, this stuff is an absolute dream to grow that asks next to nothing and yet offers an absolute ton.A quality batch ofBlue Dream Feminizedhas the potential to pack a serious punch. Treated to optimum cultivation conditions from start to finish, you could be looking atmore than 25% THCby the time youâ€™re done - though lower quality batches of bud could test for around 17% THC.In any case, itâ€™s worth remembering that it isnâ€™t the potency ofBlue Dreamthat gives her such widespread appeal. This strainâ€™s beautifully balanced high (complemented by an extraordinary flavor profile) is what makes her an absolute superstar.While there are variants available with a high CBD content, the original contains next to no CBD whatsoever â€“ usually in the region of 0.1%. If CBD is your preference, there are also versions ofBlue Dreamthat contain next to no THC, with up to 7% CBD.Therapeutic tokers often choosehigh CBD strains, though those with little to no THC are of no practical value for recreational use.SummaryBlue Dreamquickly became the single best-selling strain in the United States for a long list of reasons. Along with her fabulously fruity fragrance and flavor profile, sheâ€™s a fantastically uplifting and motivating strain thatâ€™s great for all occasions.As an added bonus, sheâ€™s also incredibly easy to grow (indoors) and often tests for a THC content of around 25%.

Seeds Supreme,https://seedsupreme.com/blueberry-x-big-devil-autoflower.html,Blueberry x Big Devil Autoflower,"Who Said Bigger Isnâ€™t Always Better?Bud BasicsBigger isnâ€™t always better? Nonsense â€“ bag yourself a batch of this oversized herb and see for yourself!Precisely as the name suggests, this potent and punchy hybrid was created by combining the genetics of Blueberry and Big Devil.Exquisitely balanced and with a pretty perfect THC content in the region of 20%, Blueberry x Big Devil Autoflower impresses with a soaring cerebral high combined with a blissful body massage.Despite leaning slightly towards the Indica side of the scale, thereâ€™s really no discernible â€˜weightâ€™ on either side of the experience. Good vibes, positive energy and a relaxing body stone, courtesy of an exceptionally flavorful strain that does both of her parents proud.Going back for more is impossible to resist after that first tasty toke, after which it's hour after hour of all-things smiley and silly.Not unknown for bringing on relentless fits of the giggles in no time at all, Blueberry x Big Devil Autoflower is also renowned for her sweet and sour berry fragrance with masses of classic skunky stink.Generous yields, a relatively easy cultivation process and no requirement to keep tabs on light/dark cycles, this isa strain that delivers far more than she demands.Flavor and Fragrance of Blueberry x Big Devil AutoflowerThe most dominant terpene in this Indica-leaning hybrid is Ocimene, though this alone doesnâ€™t give much of an indication of what to expect on the nose.Sweet and sour fruitiness is the most immediate aroma, like a plate of forest fruits with a heavy backdrop of dankness. The dank and skunky scents are intensified massively when the buds are burned, at which point the berry fragrance takes something of a backseat.This is more or less what can be expected on both the inhale and the exhale â€“ a definite and unmistakable blueberry flavor, though somewhat overtaken by classic spicy skunk. The stink of this stuff when properly cured is undeniable, making this an herb that's difficult to keep under wraps where discretion is necessary.EffectsInterestingly for an Indica-heavy hybrid, youâ€™re highly unlikely to find yourself locked to the couch with this strain. Youâ€™ll melt yourself into a puddle of helplessness if you get really carried away, but otherwise this herb's not one to have you flat on your back -precisely what makes her such a fantastic strain for more or less any time of day, though is perhaps best reserved for lazy afternoons and social situations.The initial effect is near-exclusively Sativa in nature, filling the head with a warm and tingling buzz that leaves you feeling on top of the world. Nothing particularly racy or overpowering â€“ more a case of flipping your â€˜good mood switchâ€™ and plastering your face with a silly grin.This is quickly complemented by a warm and relaxing body stone, which isnâ€™t nearly as heavy as you might expect. Giggles and massive hunger pangs are more or less inevitable, so be sure to plan ahead accordingly.Blueberry x Big Devil Autoflower isnâ€™t going to energize you to accomplish anything particularly physical, but also isnâ€™t going to leave you completely incapacitated. Afternoons and evenings really are the perfect time for this stuff â€“ bringing these budsinto the average working day probably isnâ€™t the best idea!Medical Uses of Blueberry x Big Devil AutoflowerThe balanced nature of this strainâ€™s high combined with a relatively moderate THC content (around 20%) makes this herb an extremely useful and versatile medical strain.Rather than blasting you into oblivion or knocking you clean off your feet, these budseaseyou into a pleasant and long-lasting state of complete positivity and gentle physical relaxation - all of which makes it a great choice for newcomers to therapeutic cannabis, who may not have the highest THC tolerance.Stress, anxiety, depression and mood issues are quickly reversed, replaced more with a sense of contentment than uncontrollable euphoria. Itâ€™s the same on the physical side of things â€“ pain, tension, stiffness and so are gently melted away, rather than numbing your entire body from head to toe.Itâ€™s extremely unlikely youâ€™ll take yourself over the edge with Blueberry x Big Devil Auto, unless you take things to extremes. Taking things slow with those first few tokes is (of course) sensible, but shy of massive munchies and pretty dry mouth there are no real side effects to worry about.Growing Blueberry x Big Devil Autoflower SeedsAs this is an autoflowering strain, you wonâ€™t have to worry about keeping tabs on thelight/dark cycle. In addition, auto strains naturally reach fruition faster than their regular counterparts, while at the same time remaining comparatively compact in size.Itâ€™s worth noting that Blueberry x Big Devil Autoflower does grow slightly larger than the average auto â€“ often reaching up to 150cm in height.Not that this is a bad thing;give these plants the space they needand they'llreward you with a potentially huge haul of sweet, sour and sticky weed.Youâ€™ll typically be looking at approximately 70 days from germination to flowering, at which point odor control should be prioritized.400g of bud for every square meter of grow space is the norm, making for a stink that travels quite remarkable distances.Outdoor growing is possible in cooler northern climates, as this is a strain that isnâ€™t afraid of changeable conditions or the occasional cold snap.Still, youâ€™ll get the best results by bringing things indoors and treating your crop to a solid 20 or so hours of sunshine a day.Summary This is one of those no-brainer genetic amalgamations that was never going to fail. You really cannot go wrong when combining two of the worldâ€™s most celebrated and successful strains, which in this instance resulted in a true â€˜best of both worldsâ€™ specimen.Despite being Indica-heavy and generous with the THC, Blueberry x Big Devil Autoflower isnâ€™t nearly as overpowering or incapacitating as you might expect. 20% THC is just about right for an enjoyable experience, getting to work on body and brain for a few hours of pure enjoyment.All of which is sweetened further by a comprehensively simple cultivation experience, from a strain that more or less grows herself.  Cannabis affects everyone differently. Your experience with this strain may not be the same as someone elseâ€™s.

Seeds Supreme,https://seedsupreme.com/acapulco-gold-feminized.html,Acapulco Gold,"Would you like to experience one of the oldest cannabis strains? Youâ€™re in luck: our store stocks the highest-quality Acapulco Gold seeds for sale.This sativa rose to prominence during the countercultural movement of the 60s and has remained a star since. Itâ€™s been featured in many novels, songs, films, and old-schoolersâ€™ fondest memories. Nowâ€™s the time for you to partake in its golden nugs.The burned toffee taste, uplifting high, and cultural significance make this strain sought-after among historians, daytimers, and sweet tooth tokers. Discover its origin, growing requirements, flavors, effects, medical uses, and where to get its seeds.Bud originAcapulco Gold is a cult classic. It emerged in Acapulco, Mexico, and got popularized in the US during the Hippie movement. Its allure lies in its potency, sweet taste, and euphoric effects.Itâ€™s believed this strain is a landrace: one of the originals responsible for the massive modern marijuana market. It was superior to the Texan and Californian strains Americans smoked in the 60s, which led to its widespread acclaim.Acapulco Goldâ€™s name stems from its budsâ€™ semblance to gold nuggets. For a while, it was synonymous with high-quality cannabis. In 2014, High Times included it in their 25 Greatest Strains of All Time.This strain is central to cannabis history. It was the symbol of expected legalization in the late 60s. It also fathered countless cultivars, including the renowned Skunk #1 feminized.The strain fell off as the market turned to indoor weed, but its popularity re-surged in recent years. Time-tested and steadfast, Acapulco Gold strain seeds are now facing a renaissance.Growing Acapulco Gold seedsAcapulco Gold seeds develop into lanky plants with a preference for tropical climates. They boast incredible genetic stability, consistently producing towering, high-yielding phenotypes.The strain grows best in organic soil outdoors but can produce hefty indoor harvests with tight climate control. American cultivators might employ greenhouses to satisfy their need for natural sunlight and tropical weather.Indoor plants in limited spaces remain under four feet tall, while outdoor ones may reach seven feet. Theyâ€™re skinny and thin-fingered, minimizing the need to prune for airflow and light penetration. The Screen of Green (ScrOG) technique can improve the harvest potential.Acapulco Gold is an easy plant to grow. It needs plenty of sunlight, moderate food and water, and a pest-free environment. As long as you meet these requirements, it thrives with minimal external assistance.What climate do these seeds prefer?Acapulco Gold thrives in environments resembling its native Mexican climate. In practice, this means high heat, high humidity, and plenty of sunlight. The plants can tolerate up to 85% air moisture but suffer in cold and dry weather.Sow outdoors in regions with balmy or muggy summers, choosing sunny spots with a light breeze. Carry the pots indoors if the temperature falls beneath 65Â°F.Indoor growers should maintain a 70â€“80Â°F temperature in vegging and 75â€“85Â°F in flowering. The humidity should be 50â€“60% and 40â€“50%, respectively. Slowly increase heat and reduce moisture while moving between stages.Feeding Acapulco GoldSativa plants generally display moderate appetites and susceptibility to nutrient burn. Acapulco Gold is no exception, so err on the side of caution while fertilizing the medium.Donâ€™t feed 2â€“3 weeks post-germination, as seedlings donâ€™t need supplements. Start young plants on a half-dose of nitrogen-rich vegging fertilizer and gradually increase the dose as they stretch. Watch for nutrient burn throughout the stage.Supply plants with a half-and-half blend of vegging and phosphorus-rich nutrients in pre-flowering. Transition to a flower-time fertilizer when the bud sites begin forming. Stop feeding ten days before the harvest and flush the medium to ensure a cleaner fragrance.Consider going organic to avoid nutrient troubles with this finicky sativa. Living and super soils should meet its needs without added fertilizer.Flowering & yieldsWhen you grow Acapulco Gold feminized, each plant becomes a prolific bud-bearer. Thin pistil hairs combine into bud sites and start thickening within four weeks. Your grow room emanates strong scents, necessitating a carbon filter to keep things discreet.Feed with phosphorus and potassium, reduce the watering frequency, and stop training plants in this stage. Focus on stress reduction to increase their productive potential.The foliage goes yellow and may start falling off as plants ripen. The buds shimmer in deep yellows and browns, with a light dusting on crystal trichomes at peak maturity.Indoor phenotypes yield around 17 ounces of weed per square meter after a 9â€“10 week flowering period. Outdoor gardens are harvest-ready by mid-October, carrying upwards of 52 ounces of bud per plant.Experiencing Acapulco Gold weedSmoking Acapulco Gold weed is akin to waking up on the right side of the bed. It leaves you feeling happy, motivated, and larger than life.With 15â€“23% THC and under 1% CBD, this weed packs a psychoactive punch but doesnâ€™t incapacitate. The high lasts 2â€“3 hours from the final puff, giving you a mid-length, manageable boost.People commonly blaze these buds as morning kick-starts or afternoon pick-me-ups. Besides recreational use for enjoyment, itâ€™s suitable for creatives, type-A personalities, and anybody with a long to-do list.This strain delivers a quintessential sativa high. It begins with a mood uplift and enhanced cerebral activity. Your focus sharpens, your disposition brightens, and youâ€™re ready for creative and social endeavors.The high is clean and rarely disorienting. Acapulco Gold makes you pleasantly clear-headed and capable of carrying on conversations or productive tasks. This effect is super-valuable, as motivation to get things done skyrockets after several puffs.The mental uplift translates into physical energy. This cultivar infuses your body with power, leaving you light on your toes and ready to partake in activities. The boost dissipates as you sober up, but youâ€™re not left drowsy.Despite its moderate potency, practice careful consumption with this cultivar. Overindulgence may lead to red eyes, cottonmouth, headaches, jitters, and paranoia. You can offset these side effects by staying hydrated and sticking to your limits.Aroma and flavorAcapulco Gold is caryophyllene-dominant, spicy, and multi-layered. The bouquet contains herbal myrcene, fruity linalool, floral terpinolene, and citrusy limonene.Ripening flowers smell like earth and wood, becoming muskier with curing. Connoisseurs can already detect the fruit and spice while grinding the buds.Combustion makes these fragrances come to life. The scent of a lit blunt is reminiscent of coffee, caramel, or honey: creamy, sugary, and slightly burned. The spice may make rookies cough, but the velvety smoke lessens the throat-tickling effect.The fragrance matches the flavor. The smoke is earthy-simple as you inhale but develops a chestnut and fruit taste on the exhale. A nutmeg-cinnamon aftertaste lingers on the palate.What does it help with?While medical users often turn to indica seeds, some prefer energizing therapy. Acapulco Gold gained traction in the community thanks to its uplifting and rejuvenating properties. According to users, it can also alleviate mild pains and aches.The cultivarâ€™s main therapeutic uses are for mental health. Its feel-good effects silence stressful and negative thoughts and uplift the mood. They offer a positive outlook to individuals struggling with tension, anxiety, and depression.Fatigue and focus are its other significant applications. This weed jolts the mind and body into action, sharpening concentration and encouraging movement. It might aid people with ADHD and chronic diseases.The effect profile may aid folks looking to manage pain while staying productive.

Youâ€™d expect an energizing and motivating experience, with all the get-up-and-go associated with caffeine consumptionâ€¦ right?Wrong - at least in the case of Bubba Kush Feminized.

When consumed, she gets to work on the body like a freight train loaded with sledgehammers. If youâ€™re out for an energizing daytime pick-up, this herb is pretty much the last strain you should be reaching for.Engineered by combining the genetics of OG Kush and an unknown mother plant (maybe Northern Lights), Bubba Kush tips the scales at 70% Indica and 30% Sativa. Nevertheless, the way this stuff gets to work on the body would have you thinking youâ€™re looking at a pure Indica.Capable of knocking even the most seasoned stoners clean off their feet, this hybrid routinely tests for a THC content of up to 20%.Being the feminized version of Bubba Kush, potentially problematic male plants are eliminated from the equation with these beans. All without taking anything away from the quality or potency of the final specimen.Though predominantly famed for narcotic-like effects on the body, Bubba Kush Fem also brings just the right Sativa spike into the mix.

After all, you wouldnâ€™t expect this combination of terpenes to produce a strain with a coffee-chocolate fragrance thatâ€™s impossible to resist.Coffee dominates on the nose, punctuated with rich dark chocolate and a hint of hashish. A burst of peppery spice is released when the buds are broken, further intensified when combusted with an even heavier hit of exotic hash.The smoke produced by Bubba Kush Feminized is rich, dense and satisfying, though rarely cough-inducing.

Seeds Supreme,https://seedsupreme.com/blue-cookies-feminized.html,Blue Cookies,"A Product of Pure PedigreeBud BasicsThe result of a smash-hit union between two strains of unequaled infamy, Girl Scout Cookies and Blueberry come together to create this super-sweet, heavy-yielding monster of a hybrid with more THC than youâ€™ll know what to do with.Seriously â€“ get it right with Blue Cookies Feminized and you could be looking at up to a whopping 28% THC!Despite leaning slightly towards the Indica side of the scale (60%), this pot promises a well-balanced high that gets to work on body and mind with equal effectiveness. This has also made Blue Cookies Feminized an extremely popular strain in medical cannabis circles, famed for her near-endless therapeutic applications. From bouts of creative block to mood-swings to everyday aches and pains, thereâ€™s almost nothing this stuff canâ€™t alleviate in an instant.In terms of fragrance and flavor, these buds bring out the best of their parent strains and their parent strains before them, as an added bonus (Girl Scout Cookies having originated through a combination of OG Kush and Durban Poison, whereas Blueberry is an amalgamation of Afghani, Thai and other reputable landrace strains).As you can tell, pretty much everything thatâ€™s gone into Blue Cookies Feminized over the years is award-winning and acclaimed, resulting in an absolute monster of a 21st century hybrid.Just be sure to approach those first few hits with care, as stronger batches of these buds can be quite overwhelming â€“ even for those who (think they) know what theyâ€™re doing.Flavor and Fragrance of Blue Cookies FeminizedThe appeal of Blue Cookies Fem is understandable with a single sniff.Initially, the strainâ€™s GSC lineage dominates on the nose, with an earthy and almost pine-like fragrance underscored by notes of coffee and fuel.Thereâ€™s also a fair amount of spicy hash and classic skunkiness in the background â€“ both of which explode into life when the buds are broken. At which point, you also get a much more pronounced waft of sweet and sour berries, which is intensified massively with proper curing.When well-cured Blue Cookies buds are burned, the resulting flavor profile is exceptionally complex.

Depending on the potency of the batch youâ€™re holding, this could mean anything from weighty relaxation to complete and total incapacitation for the duration. Couch-lock is to be expected sooner or later, along with completely unavoidable bouts of the munchies.This stuff is also notorious for bringing on cottonmouth like youâ€™ve never experienced, so you might want to plan for that with plenty of fluids.Planning ahead with Blue Cookies Feminized is the way to go, given how the effects have a tendency to linger for several hours. Great if youâ€™ve nothing on your agenda â€“ bad news if you need to drag yourself out of the house for any reason.Medical Uses of Blue Cookies FeminizedThe potential therapeutic applications of this herb are numerous to say the least.

Experienced cultivators might use the Screen of Green (ScrOG) training technique for higher harvests.What climate do these seeds prefer?Due to its ruderalis and landrace genetics, Quarter Pounder loves the great outdoors. It performs best in warm, dry, and sunny conditions.Sow outdoors in places with a Mediterranean-type climate, like American coastal areas. If your region is cold or humid, install a greenhouse to harness the sunlight while employing devices to optimize the environment.Indoor cultivators should maintain temperatures in the 68â€“75Â°F range. Humidity levels of 45â€“55% in vegging and 35â€“45% in flowering are ideal.Feeding Quarter PounderQuarter Pounder seeds develop into plants that thrive in any medium. The autoflowering variant isnâ€™t as hungry as a photoperiod, but generous feedings fuel its development.Start seedlings at a half-dose of nitrogen-rich fertilizer 2â€“3 weeks post-germination. Increase the dose when the plants surpass a foot in height. Maintain a regular feeding schedule and watch for nutrient burn and deficiency symptoms.When plants enter pre-flowering, supply a half-and-half mix of vegging and blooming fertilizer. Transition to a phosphorus-rich, low-nitrogen blend after the flowering stretch and stop feeding two weeks before the harvest. Flush for the cleanest bud flavor.Flowering & yieldsLike most seeds of sativa strains, Quarter Pounder has a long flowering period. These crops take 8â€“10 weeks to produce buds and ripen. This stage begins with a growth spurt and the emergence of pre-flowers.Low stress and plenty of light are the go-toâ€™s for prosperous flowering. Provide ample food and water and stop any training during this stage. You might prune in mid-blooming to boost the bud sitesâ€™ exposure to air and light.Pale green clusters with oblong flowers pop up at the internodes. Sugar leaves encircle the buds, which sprout fiery pistils and develop generous trichome coatings.The yields are mid-to-high. Indoor gardens produce 14 ounces of sticky weed per square meter, while each outdoor plant carries over 21 ounces of nugs.Experiencing Quarter Pounder weedAutoflower Quarter Pounder buds are psychoactive powerhouses. They contain 20â€“27% THC and 0.5% CBD, packing a punch that makes them most suitable for experienced tokers. Their effects are fast-acting and last for 3â€“4 hours.The effect profile is unexpected for a sativa-dominant strain. While it has potent cerebral properties, it replaces physical energy with profound relaxation. Itâ€™s best to leave these buds for the back half of your day.The first few puffs bring a pulsing sensation behind the temples, heralding an enhanced mental state. Your thoughts increase in speed and intensity, flowing in free association. Negative ideas seem far away, and your perception feels ten times sharper.The head high lends itself to various scenarios.

You can soothe dry eyes and cottonmouth with hydration and eye drops. Overconsumption may cause jitteriness, paranoia, and drowsiness, so start slow and stick to your limits.Aroma and flavorQuarter Pounder is limonene-dominant, which accounts for its sweet-and-sour qualities. An array of musky terpenes and flavonoids adds complexity to the bouquet.Ripening buds emanate a rich citrus scent reminiscent of overripe lemons and oranges. An earthy base becomes prominent in curing, and combustion deepens the aroma.This weed produces thick plumes of smoke that smell like fruit and skunk. Connoisseurs notice faint pine, cheese, earth, and floral notes in its composition.The fragrance translates into the flavor. Fresh fruit hits the palate on the inhale, resembling a bite of a juicy orange.

Seeds Supreme,https://seedsupreme.com/power-plant-feminized.html,Power Plant,"A Smooth & Spicy Sativa of Soaring HighsBud BasicsThe product of several South African landrace strains, Power Plant Feminized is a particularly potent Sativa-heavy hybrid strain that appeals on all counts, from her earthy, woodsy aroma, to her soaring, euphoric buzz.Cannabis connoisseurs whoâ€™ve sampled this weed wonâ€™t be surprised to hear that sheâ€™s a multi-award winning specimen, released in 1997 to win her first second-place award at the High Life Cup in 2006, and going on to win first place in 2008 and again in 2009.With a THC content of between 18% and 20%, this popular daytime strain works to boost your vigor with her clear-headed high. Despite her Sativa-dominance though, this herb has just enough Indica to temper her chatterbox side and keep you from getting out of control while you toke.Since the uplifting effects of this pot are so potent, sheâ€™s a choice strain for medical tokers, and though she can alleviate various aches and pains, sheâ€™s truly phenomenal when it comes to psychological issues such as stress and anxiety.Power Plant is in high demand in dispensaries across the globe, but luckily those looking to cultivate their own stash will find growing her to be an absolute breeze. Though her growth traits make for a tall and lanky specimen, this works in your favor when it comes to the size of her humongous nugs.Yes, this hybridis a damn heavy yielder, and a dream to grow with only the most basic of requirements. And thatâ€™s not to mention that her all-fem seeds make pollination a concern of the past.Flavor and Fragrance of Power Plant FeminizedThereâ€™s something deliciously natural in lighting up a joint of Power Plant Fem, like youâ€™re communing with nature as you inhale the pungent, earth and wood notes and herbal aroma.In flavor, sheâ€™s a sharper, spicier toke with notes of pepper in her smooth smoke that linger in the mouth long after youâ€™re done.EffectsYou wouldnâ€™t name a mild strain Power Plant, so itâ€™s no surprise to hear that this herb's a fairly potent entry at 18% to 20% THC content.Sativa-leaning with a strong but still clear-headed high, that lifts up your mood into a state of sheer euphoria.As this sensation begins to intensify, youâ€™ll notice an increase inyour energy and vigor, which is ideal for creative pursuits. To balance this out, this strainâ€™s Indica side will bestow a physical sense of calm that grounds you and ensures you donâ€™t become hyperactive or silly. Thiscan make for a great pre-work smoke to set you up for the day.Due to Power Plantâ€™s enthusiastic chatterbox effect, she can be a great weed for parties and social occasions, sure to get you in the mood.Though a popular daytime strain and wake-and-bake, this herb can also work well when you need to pull an all-nighter, as she gives you just the right amount of energy to power through tasks. Keep in mind thoughthat a few tokes will keep you awake for hours, so if youâ€™re after an early night, best skip this one.Though there are many positives to this ganja, she has some downsides just like any other strain. Commonly, tokers report dry, red and bloodshot eyes and cottonmouth, but these are easily rectified by drinking plenty of water before, during and after your sesh.More adverse effects seem to occur with first-time tokers, or those with a poor THC tolerance. Theseinclude headaches, lightheadedness and dizziness, and sometimes increased anxiety and heightened paranoia. To avoid such occurrences, keep it low and slow, or opt for a lower THC strain.Medical Uses of Power Plant FeminizedAs much as Power Plant Fem is awesome recreationally, sheâ€™s also versatile enough to be useful on the medical scene, and her popularity within the medicinal marijuana community continues to grow.As a Sativa-heavy strain, this cannabis is commonly used for her psychological benefits, as her euphoric effects can clear stress and worry from the mind and instead replace them with happier thoughts and a more positive outlook - great for combatting anxiety, depression and PTSD.Due to this herbâ€™s THC content, sheâ€™s also proficient as an analgesic and anti-inflammatory, capable of easing the symptoms of conditions like migraines, arthritis, inflammation and more.Like many cannabis strains, Power Plant also has an appetite boosting effective, colloquially referred to as â€œthe munchiesâ€. For those struggling with nausea as a side effect of such treatments as chemotherapy, or those with a lack of appetite due to eating disorders, this weed can work wonders to bring on serious hunger pangs that are impossible to ignore.Growing Power Plant Feminized SeedsAn entirely pleasurable growing experience, cultivatingPower Plant Feminized is simple whether youâ€™re a novice grower or more seasoned. Fuss-free with feminized seeds to reduce time spent identifying males in the batch and minimize the chance of pollination.Heavy-yielding as she is, this plant is average-sized at between 3 and 5 feet when fully mature, with buds that occasionally reach up to a foot in length. Exhibiting classic Sativa growth traits, she tends to stretch upwards and requires the space to grow, so indoor growers should take this into consideration before germinating.Indoors, a Screen of Green (SCROG) setup will improve both the quality of the buds and the amount produced, particularly when combined with regular pruning. Indoors, cultivators should also be aware that this herb has a strong scent that permeates surprisingly well, so weâ€™d recommend the use of an odor filtration system to keep that aroma under control.Power Plant flowers for between 8 and 10 weeks, and in an optimal environment yields beautifully to provide 1.6 to 2 ounces of nugs per square foot.Outdoors, this plant can impress even further with larger yields. She loves the sunny and warm climes of the Mediterranean but can thrive in a northern, cooler environment as well with proper timing. Take care of her, and sheâ€™ll be ready for harvesting around the middle of October, yielding around 21 ounces per plant.SummaryFollowing on from her noughties award victories, Power Plant Feminized went on to receive a further three titles in 2016 as yet more evidence that this strain just gets better and better.An all-natural herbal experience, the wood and incense notes of this weed blend into a delightfully smooth smoke that coats and softens the throat even as she invigorates the mind. A cerebral and soaring affair, this ganjaâ€™s high is a great choice for all-nighters, social occasions, or even to get you through the working day - but as a medicinal strain, sheâ€™s truly a winner for psychological maladies.Great for newbies just learning their craft, Power Plant Fem is an easy strain to grow right from the start, with all-fem seeds removing pollination concerns and growth traits that require only a SCROG setup and a bit of pruning to keep in check. Pungent she may be, but aside from taking up plenty of vertical space, there are no real downsides to this hybrid, and her yields are enormous and speak for themselves.  Cannabis affects everyone differently. Your experience with this strain may not be the same as someone elseâ€™s. Growing conditionsâ€”including light, nutrients, and pot sizeâ€”play a major role in shaping the plantâ€™s yield, potency, and flavor profile.

We recommend growing organically as possible with cannabis nutrient kits and you should have minimal issues reaching flowering within 8 to 10 weeks.However, one important detail on these seeds to keep in mind is that they are regular seeds. Therefore, they can produce both male and female plants. Therefore, expect a mixture of female and male seeds in your package too!Capable of growing well both indoors and outdoors, this plant tends to perform well in temperature ranges of 70-80Â°F and humidity levels around 40-50% during the vegetative stage, dropping to 40% in the last weeks of flowering to avoid mold.

Seeds Supreme,https://seedsupreme.com/lowryder-autoflower.html,Lowryder Autoflower,"The Grandfather Christmas of Autoflowering StrainsBud BasicsAs the first genuine autoflowering marijuana strain, Lowryder is a big name and the granddaddy of them all amongst the cannabis community. Named for her tiny stature, autoflowering isnâ€™t this herb's only talent - fast-growing and flavorful, this is a weed thatâ€™s worth growing several batches at once, because once youâ€™ve toked this strain youâ€™ll struggle to give it up.It takes time and patience to breed a strain like this, and selective breeding across nine generations was necessary to accomplish such a feat. Williamâ€™s Wonder is responsible for Lowryderâ€™s scent and structure, Mexican Rudy donated her size and flavor, and Northern Lights #2 gave this marijuana her all-important potency. With a lineage like that, itâ€™s no wonder this strain is one of the most popular on the market.Discrete to grow and to smoke, the sweet pine scent and citrus notes of Lowryder have been accurately labeled as â€˜the smell of Christmasâ€™, and weâ€™re inclined to agree that her flavor and effects invite something of a holiday feeling.The slow-building cerebral buzz of this cannabis is well-balanced with clearheadedness and a lightness of body that eases every aching muscle. As such, itâ€™s no wonder that the medical marijuana (MMJ) community love this strain for her pain-relieving properties, and those seeking psychological salvation can enjoy her benefits too.Growing this weed is a breeze, since her flowering period is short, and sheâ€™s a small enough strain to cultivate and manage anywhere. Lowryder Auto doesnâ€™t make for a particularly big yield, but given how many times you can grow her in a year, youâ€™ll still find yourself with a steady supply.Flavor and Fragrance of Lowryder AutoflowerWhen tokers compare the scent of a strain to the smell of Christmas, you know that ganja is going to be a gift - and the sweet and mellow aroma of Lowryder really is. With faint notes of pine and strong citrus notes, there arenâ€™t very many smokers that would turn their nose up at this strain.In flavor, that sweetness expands to include a delectable fruitiness that emphasizes the smooth and buttery pine notes in the smoke - lemon and butterscotch, anyone?EffectsThe very definition of â€˜small and mightyâ€™, though Lowryder Auto looks like a cute baby cannabis, sheâ€™s punchier than youâ€™d expect. THC levels in this strain tend to vary from 10% to 20%, but no matter where she falls youâ€™ll find yourself on the receiving end of a pleasant cerebral buzz.More of a slow-builder, thereâ€™s no need to worry about getting overwhelmed with this herb, as sheâ€™ll start off gentle before intensifying to a soaring high that has you floating on Cloud 9.While youâ€™re drifting up there in the sky, youâ€™ll find your mind filled with an elated feeling that boosts your mood whilst keeping you focused and clear-headed, courtesy of Lowryderâ€™s Sativa side.Soon after, this herb's Indica effects will begin to drift in, your body feeling light enough to stay up in the clouds whilst stress is soothed from every knot and kink. As you can imagine, that makes this a choice weed for introspection, and practicing meditation, as peaceful feelings are unavoidable with this stuff.All the while, youâ€™ll stay alert and ready to go, since this isnâ€™t a weed that lends itself to couchlock - though give it a few hours, and once she brings you back to earth, youâ€™ll be off to dreamland in no time.Considered to be ideal after-work cannabis, Lowryder Autoflower will increase focus and usher in good cheer to help you dedicate your time to something a little more soul-happy at the end of the day.Medical Uses of Lowryder AutoflowerThere are substantial medical and therapeutic benefits to Lowryder Auto that continue to make this strain an absolute gift. Notable for bestowing serenity, calm, and an uplifted mood on tokers, consuming this strain can ease psychological ailments such as anxiety, stress and depression.A joint of Lowryder can increase focus, both recreationally and medicinally, and as such can be used to great effect to improve attention span and concentration levels. These properties make this ganja a potent choice for those suffering from attention disorders such as ADD and ADHD, as her calming effects can also reduce hyperactivity.Favored by patients who struggle with a variety of aches and pains, this weed will work wonders on the symptoms of arthritis, migraine and fibromyalgia. Capable of reducing nausea and vomiting, Lowryder can also be used to great effect by those suffering from the side effects of chemotherapy.A surprisingly strong strain, this pot is likely to cause at least some adverse reactions, usually along the lines of dry eyes and cottonmouth, which can be easily remedied by ensuring you stay hydrated at all times.For newbies and those with lower THC tolerances, these side effects could worsen to include dizziness, heightened anxiety and increased paranoia, and so weâ€™d recommend switching to a strain thatâ€™s less potent, or reducing your dosage.Growing Lowryder Autoflower SeedsAs an autoflowering strain,these seeds donâ€™t rely on light cycles to flower, and will remain fairly small throughout their lifespans at no more than 12 inches. Due to this independence, this strain will thrive in almost any environment, even in colder climes - meaning that those new to cannabis cultivation can grow this marijuana with only basic skills and knowledge, and may not even need to have a grow room in place to succeed.Since sheâ€™s a little lady, this ganja will produce fewer bugs when compared to taller strains, and so a decent yield is only guaranteed when employing a Sea of Green (SoG) setup, where cultivators grow several plants at once, or several batches.Ideal for a windowsill or balcony, this tiny plant can be grown almost anywhere, and is neither conspicuous nor strong in odor. Whatâ€™s more, with a 5-week flowering stage, no nosy neighbor will have time to notice what youâ€™re up to before youâ€™re harvesting 50 grams of nugs per square meter.Outdoors, if planted in a good location thatâ€™s nice and warm, Lowryderâ€™s yield will go up considerably, to between 60 and 90 grams of buds per plant. Since she only takes 60 days to get to this stage, why not enjoy several harvests a year and keep that stash stocked up?Stick with the warmer months and avoid the winter though, as though sheâ€™s a toughy, this strain doesnâ€™t do well in frosty weather, despite her popularity in countries like Canada and Finland.SummaryCannabis of Christmas cheer and Christmas flavors - thatâ€™s Loweryder Autoflower in a nut(cracker) shell. Sweet citrus and pine notes are only the first gifts of this strain, since her cerebral highs have you walking in the air as they slowly intensify to clear the head, calm the mind and ease the body into bliss.A miracle of medicinal marijuana, for a low CBD strain, Lowryder can still pull her weight, ideal for soothing the symptoms of arthritis and fibromyalgia, alongside her many benefits for patients with mental health concerns.Since this weed doesnâ€™t rely on light cycles, she doesnâ€™t need to rely on you either - sheâ€™ll grow in almost any environment that isnâ€™t too frosty, and matures quickly in around 5 weeks. For seasoned growers, sheâ€™s a doddle, and for newbies - what better than a strain where you literally canâ€™t go wrong?  Cannabis affects everyone differently.

Seeds Supreme,https://seedsupreme.com/sour-diesel-feminized.html,Sour Diesel,"A Strain By Any Other Name Would Smell As SourBud BasicsKnown on the 420 scene by various names, Sour Diesel Feminized may also be referred to as Sour D or Sour Deez - but whatâ€™s in a name, really? Well actually, ole Shakey might have been wrong there, as the most well-known trait of this weed is her potent and pungent aroma, blending gasoline with a lemon twist to provide a surprisingly mouth-watering flavor.As potent in effects as she is in her fuel-like flavor, this Sativa-dominant hybrid strainis energizing and uplifting and impossible to dismiss for stoners who prefer their weed with a good kick. Which is guaranteed when you consider her THC content can reach up to 25%.A vigorous wake-and-bake of epic proportions, this mood-boosting marijuana can also work well as an evening strain for a night of socializing and is a choice recreational pot.Though little is known about this ganjaâ€™s origins, whatâ€™s suspected is based upon her distinct and unique aroma and taste, and the effects she has both for getting you high and as a medical strain. Probably a blend of Super Skunk and Chemdawg, Sour Diesel Femâ€™s citrus tang is a great option for those seeking reprieve from stress, anxiety and depression, as well as those suffering from fatigue and a variety of mild to moderate pain disorders.Fuss-free and feminized for your convenience, these beans and their cerebral highs can be cultivated with ease at home, requiring some vertical space and a warm and humid environment to thrive.Ganja growers will love this herb's sturdiness and ability to thrive indoors or out, regardless of how you choose to grow her. And (just between us), these generous yields are pretty damn impressive, too.Flavor and Fragrance of Sour Diesel FeminizedThe gasoline and diesel aroma for which Sour Diesel Feminized is named is likely due to the rumored Skunk in her genetics, as itâ€™s notably one of the most pungent and distinct scents on the 420 scene.Blending kerosene notes and a hint of herbs and spices into her fragrance, this weed becomes suddenly more sour and citrus-filled once combusted.Seasoned smokers adore the sour earth notes in the taste of this pot, underpinned by a subtle earthiness that becomes more fuel-like when exhaled. The flavors can be a little overpowering and strong on the first toke, but once youâ€™ve acclimatized, youâ€™ll find her aftertaste to be particularly mouthwatering in nature.EffectsA mostly Sativa strain, Sour Diesel Fem is still a well-balanced hybrid with some Indica oomph. Perfect as a wake-and-bake, this pot is also a choice strain for a night on the town with friends or social occasions that require a little more energy at the end of the day.The very definition of a happy high, sheâ€™s a popular recreational strain thanks to her stimulating and invigorating effects and is enjoyed by many creative types such as writers, artists and musicians for the motivation and innovation she provides.Thanks to her physical side, these energizing effects are grounded from being too overwhelming or from inducing hyperactivity and giddiness, as the calming edge of this cannabistempers that Sativa kick so you donâ€™t get too carried away.Still, thatâ€™s a whole lot of stimulation from one all-natural upper, since she clocks in at around 24% THC. New tokers should probably sit this one out and opt for a milder strain (unless you're feeling brave!).Of course, there are the usual uncomfortable additions of dry, red and bloodshot eyes and cottonmouth. Thankfully, thoseside effects of Sour Diesel Fem are easy enough to handle with OTC eye drops and plenty of water to keep you hydrated during your session.More adverse effects can come on from over-consuming this herb though, and can lead to headaches, dizziness, heightened anxiety and increased paranoia in those with low-THC sensitivity. Keeping it low and slow can help, but if not, switch to another strain.Medical Uses of Sour Diesel FeminizedAn all-natural alternative to traditionally prescribed medication for both mental ailments and pain relief, Sour Diesel Feminized is popular amongst the medicinal marijuana (MMJ) communityfor the treatment of both, thanks to her high THC content and uplifting Sativa side.As this herb's effects include an energizing effect alongside an ability to improve mood and positive outlook, Sour Diesel Fem can be a potent relief for those struggling with everyday worries, stress, anxiety and low mood and depression.Her cerebral effect is enlivening and uplifting enough to swiftly remove feelings of negativity and intrusive thoughts while allowing you the energy to go about your day productively.Sour Diesel also happens to contain analgesic and anti-inflammatory qualities that make her popular amongst patients seeking organic relief from chronic pain.

Such a sparkling appearance is due to the sheer volume of sticky trichomes this stuff produces, making her particularly difficult to break apart without a grinder to hand.Growing no more than 5 feet, sheâ€™s not the tallest strain youâ€™ll come across, but by no means the shortest either. CultivateSour Diesel Feminized indoors wherever possible for best results. Thisrequires a controlled set up to keep her environment warm and humid - and to ensure she gets the right level of support for her huge colas, once she really gets going.Sheâ€™ll do well enough in organic soil if youâ€™re looking to boost her terps (terpenes), but to really boost her growth, pair hydroponics with a Sea of Green (SOG) or Screen of Green (SCROG) technique to be pleasantly surprised come harvest time.Flowering for around 10 weeks, Sour Dieselâ€™s feminized seeds ensure that males and the risk of pollination in your batch are as minimal as possible, and all of the sticky 1.63 ounces per square foot youâ€™ll yield will be consumable.Outdoors, this strain is like most marijuana - a big fan of a warm Mediterranean climate with plenty of sun and a gentle breeze. In such an environment, she might grow as tall as 6 or 7 feet, though thatâ€™s less likely in the north, where harvest time will be around the last week of October.Growing Sour Diesel Feminized outdoors will require a little more maintenance, as the less control you have over her environment, the more at risk she is of molds and mildews developing. Still, sheâ€™ll reward you handsomely with around 24 ounces per plantof those super sticky nugs.SummarySince she was a child of the 80s and 90s, itâ€™s hard to fathom the mysterious origins of this herb beyond comparing her terps and flavors to other potential parent strains. But still, the cannabis community are agreed upon once thing: this ganja is a staple variety, not to be missed.Sour Diesel Feminized has been legendary for a while now, and for good reason. Her pungent aroma is instantly recognizable by its sour-lemon and gasoline notes which blend to create a surprisingly enticing toke. Once sheâ€™s hit the lungs, her invigorating effects are ideal to get you going in the morning, or keep you going at night. Either way, youâ€™ll be bursting with energy and happy as hell.Medically, sheâ€™s a blessing to MMJ tokers for her uplifting Sativa effects, and a quick and effective reprieve from stress and anxiety. Thankfully, sheâ€™s also easy to grow at home. All-fem and high-yielding with little work to be done beyond some environmental control and a little support for her humongous colas. And who can complain at that?  Cannabis affects everyone differently. Your experience with this strain may not be the same as someone elseâ€™s.

Seeds Supreme,https://seedsupreme.com/afghan-hawaiian-x-laos-x-jamaican-feminized.html,Afghan Hawaiian x Laos x Jamaican,"Three Times the Pleasure Bud Basics Chances are, you donâ€™t need us to spell out for you which three all-time classics came together to create this new-generation hybrid. Erring heavily towards the Sativa side of the scale, this is exactly the type of strain you need when looking to boost your mood and generally improve your day.Energizing, motivating and empowering in the extreme, Afghan Hawaiian x Laos x Jamaican gets to work with fast-paced high thatâ€™s great for daytime use.Whatâ€™s the catch? Shy of the fact youâ€™ll need a pretty well-developed THC tolerance, there isnâ€™t one. Often testing for as much as 25% THC, Afghan Hawaiian x Laos x Jamaican has a tendency to tread a fine line between enjoyable and overwhelming.Consume a little and youâ€™re fired up for a busy day - consume a lot and youâ€™re in for the psychedelic experience of a lifetime. Moderation therefore, iskey, unless propelling yourself all the way into Wonderland is your objective.Still, thereâ€™s enough Indica genetics in this three-way cross to bring at least a little physical relaxation into the mix. Not to such an extent as to knock you out, but enough to keep you physically groundedfor the duration.Afghan Hawaiian x Laos x Jamaican Feminized is far from the simplest plant to grow at home, but guarantees stupendous rewards for those who make the grade. Itâ€™s not as if you need much 25% THC weed to have the desired effect, but the way these beautiesyieldalmost always sets you up with more than youâ€™ll know what to do with.Flavor and Fragrance of Afghan Hawaiian x Laos x Jamaican FeminizedOn the nose, properly cured buds entice with a sweet and juicy peach-like aroma, spiked with sharp citrus and a wave of underlying dank. Thereâ€™s more classic skunky goodness when the buds are broken, complimented with a gentle layer of spice when burned.The flavor isnâ€™t quite as sweet as it is sour, with a pronounced bitterness like unsweetened lemons. Citrus notes take precedence on both the inhale and the exhale, complemented by a smooth and satisfying smoke thatâ€™s also exceptionally refreshing. The curious sweet and sour citrus fragrance lingers in the vicinity for hours on end, though with more than enough old-school cannabis stink to give the game away.She's not the easiest strain to keep under wraps, but also isn'ttoo difficult to keep discreet before actually setting fire to the buds. EffectsThe ancestry of Afghan Hawaiian x Laos x Jamaican paved the way for a predominantly Sativa hybrid, which delivers the high-energy experience needed when dealing with a depressingly dull day.Itâ€™s important to bear in mind that moderation is essential with this herb, as THC in the region of 25% is pretty much the norm. Particularly if you need to function like a normal member of the human race for the next few hours, treading carefully is the way to go.Consumed in modest quantities, Afghan Hawaiian x Laos x Jamaican Fembrings on the most inspiring and near-intoxicating sense of confidence and outgoingness.This is the kind of strain that fires you up for whatever it is you happen to be doing - anything from complex projects at work to the most mundane of chores at home. Youâ€™re inspired to give it your best and show the world what you can do, all the while with a sense of complete contentment and optimism.Still, take it just a toke too far and youâ€™ll probably find yourself chatting both relentlessly and nonsensically to anyone in the vicinity. All accompanied by a moronic grin from ear to ear, making it pretty obvious to everyone around youâ€™ve had more than a cup of coffee. Particularly if and when the whole thing descends into fits of hysterical laughter, youâ€™ll find it practically impossible to focus on anything important.The Indica side of the high makes its presence known after an hour or two, though manifests as little more than a very slight sensation of warm relaxation.Medical Uses of Afghan Hawaiian x Laos x Jamaican FeminizedAs youâ€™d expect from a strain with predominantly Sativa genetics, Afghan Hawaiian x Laos x Jamaican has a long list of potential therapeutic applications. The vast majority of which are psychological in nature - any physical effects being significantly less pronounced.Anything and everything that may be on your mind at the time is eradicated in a single toke. With a THC content that often hovers around 25%, you need only a tiny quantity of this stuff to put you in a better state of mind. Even those plagued by relatively severe anxiety, stress, depression and mood issues have reported remarkable and long-lasting relief after switching to this strain.This cannabis can also be just the thing for dealing with bouts of lethargy, or when struggling to cope with the aftereffects of a poor nightâ€™s sleep. Though itâ€™s worth pointing out that anyone struggling with insomnia (temporary or ongoing) should avoid Sativa-heavy cannabis at all costs.Speaking of which, the same also applies to anyone with an underdeveloped THC tolerance or a history of panic attacks. The way this herb hits after those first few tokes is often too hard and heavy for even experienced smokers to handle - newcomers and novice users having no chance whatsoever!Growing Afghan Hawaiian x Laos x Jamaican Feminized SeedsIn terms of the actual cultivation process itself, this isnâ€™t a particularly difficult strain to grow. She's not hugely demanding where weather or soil conditions are concerned, nor is sheparticularly susceptible to mold, mildew and rot.Instead, the challenge here lies in the fact that unless you go nuts with the pruning and training, your plants will easily exceed 18-20 feet in height. All the while bending and breaking under their own weight, due to their tendency to overestimate their own capabilities.Subsequently, outdoor growing in a reasonably stable environment is really the only way to go. Structural support will be essential from start to finish, which should also be taken into account.Flowering times can be somewhat lengthy at around 13 weeks, but this really isnâ€™t long to wait for the spectacular yields that follow. Get it right and itâ€™s perfectly possible for a single Afghan Hawaiian x Laos x Jamaican plant to produce as much as 1.2kg of weed!Summary Growing your own Afghan Hawaiian x Laos x Jamaican at home isnâ€™t impossible and can be extremely rewarding. Itâ€™s simply a case of finding an appropriate outdoor spot, choosing the right time of year and providing your plants with the structural support they need. All of which is a small price to pay, when considering just how much ultra-potent weed youâ€™ll be harvesting a while later.With predominantly Sativa genetics and anaverage 25% THC content, Afghan Hawaiian x Laos x Jamaican is no less than a mind-blowing three-way hybrid thatâ€™s guaranteed to test your tolerance and your cultivation chops.

You could describe the thickness and heaviness of her skunky flavor as doughy, but this really is just about as close as it gets to wedding cake in the traditional sense.Instead, youâ€™re in for a predominantly sour and earthy fragrance that honks ofold-schoolSkunkâ€“ courtesy of a generous cocktail of terpenes, which includes myrcene, terpinolene, limonene, ocimene, beta-caryophyllene, humulene, alpha-bisabolol, alpha-pinene and beta-pinene among others.Not that any of this is a bad thing â€“ itâ€™s simply a case of ensuring you donâ€™t set yourself up for a disappointment. Set light toWedding Cakebuds and itâ€™s more of the same â€“ plenty of wet earth,bucketloads of skunkinessand a huge hit of sourness. There is a little bit of sugary sweetness on the exhale, but is nonetheless overwhelmed almost entirely by earthiness.Some say a low-temperature vaporizer is best for appreciating the complexity ofWedding Cake Feminized, but this is open to debate. Consider your use of this stuff carefully if discretion is important, as you can smell these nugs from a mile away before you even spark up.EffectsUnlike her unexpected flavor and fragrance profile, the high ofWedding Cake Feminizedis rather exactly as expected from ahigh THC strainranging from 27 to 30% levels, and with heavy Indica leanings.A couple of moderate tokes of these buds and youâ€™re instantly propelled into a world of pure psychedelia, coupled with anincapacitating body stonethatâ€™s absolutely couchlocking in nature.Youâ€™ll need to consume this cannabis with caution and avoid overindulging if youâ€™re hoping for any chance of functioning beyond your own private chilled-out bubble.Serenely sedated from head to toe and gliding around without a care in the world is the name of the game with this ganja, but it can be super easy to overdo it withWedding Cake, so take care.Expectedly, this makes these buds largely only suitable for a fantastic evening smoke when youâ€™ve got nothing to do â€“ only those with a truly superhuman tolerance should consider consuming this stuff early in the day.Medical Uses of Wedding Cake FeminizedThe list of potential medical applications for this awesome strain is practically endless. By combining apotent mood-boostwith a sense ofnear-incapacitating physical relaxation, this stuff is capable of wiping out just about anything causing you trouble at the time.Chronic pain conditions, joint stiffness and anything that has you feeling physically tense will be blasted into oblivion in seconds.If youâ€™re suffering from insomnia or a comparable sleep disorder, a small amount ofWedding Cake Feminizedis enough to bring on an epic nightâ€™s sleep. Or if youâ€™re simply feeling fed up and anxious at the end of an awful day, these buds will melt away your cares for hours on end.The only slight downside of this hybrid is her sometimes overwhelming potency for novice smokers. Both in recreational and medicinal contexts alike, itâ€™s wise to approach this strain with extreme caution if youâ€™re not a seasoned smoker.Growing Wedding Cake Feminized SeedsYou donâ€™t need to be a seasoned commercial cultivator to get it right, but growingWedding Cake Feminizedtakes a little more TLC to produce than some of her counterparts.Humidity should be kept relatively low at all times, as these plants do have a tendency to succumb to mold.Flowering times come in at around eight weeks, after which you should be looking at around 15oz of quality cannabis for every mature plant. Which is pretty generous, considering that average THC content hits 27%.CultivatingWedding Cake Feminizedoutdoors requires a pretty stable and sunny Mediterranean-like climate for best results.

Whatâ€™s more, these feminized seeds mean youâ€™re more or less guaranteed nothing but healthy female plants.SummaryThis stuff may bear no resemblance whatsoever to conventional wedding cake, but is arguably even more enjoyable. That is, just as long as youâ€™re setting yourself in for an extended period of relaxation and incapacitation.With Indica-heavy properties and a whopping 27% THC,Wedding Cake Feminizedis not for the faint-hearted.

They can also survive in cold environments. This isnâ€™t a justification to expose them to frost for long periods, though.

Thereâ€™s no need to adjust the light schedule for more hours of darkness.While flowering, you may further enhance bud quality. Maintaining an 18/16, 20/4, or 24/0 light-dark cycle works magic.

In this stoner flick, Donny is the father of a child called Han Solo Berger.Things are reversed in the 420 world. Han Solo Burger is the parent strain of Donny Burger, along with GMO. Growers wanted to create seeds of female cannabis plants that deliver potent buds.GMO (Garlic, Mushrooms, and Onions) is an indica-dominant cultivar. It has a powerful garlic kick packaged in the classic skunk aroma. This lip-smacking toke delivers a deeply relaxing and uplifting full-body buzz.Han Solo Burger is a popular Burger cultivar that fans love for its funky, cheesy flavor.

With the right techniques, you can reap generous, potent yields.These hybrid weed seeds are hard to come by, so give them proper care. The plants produce forest-green buds with flaming orange stigmata and glistening trichomes. You can even spot these colors in pictures of Donny Burger. The nugs are dense and packed with juicy resin.The Donnie Burger strain thrives in any grow medium, but does especially well in soil. This substrate preserves the flavor and boosts the unique terpenoid content.Use the paper towel technique during the Donny Burger seeds germination stage. This method offers a high success rate and fast results. Itâ€™s also affordable and straightforward.Indoor growingDonny Burger thrives in a warm, Mediterranean-like climate. Itâ€™s resilient and resistant to mold and mildew thanks to its parents. Donâ€™t dismiss the need to control humidity indoors, as other problems, like root rot, may arise.This strain poses a rare challenge for indica seeds: overstretching. Left untreated, the branches grow rapidly, leaving scattered, weak buds. Apply low-stress training (LST) techniques like the Sea of Green (SOG). They prevent excessive growth and ensure plump buds.Use a UV light to boost terpenes for the tastiest buds. Marijuana makes extra trichomes as a means of self-defense from the harsh rays. Another trick is to turn the lights off 24â€“48 hours prior to harvest. It stresses the plants, causing them to produce more crystals.For increased bag value, drop the temperature in the latter blooming stage. Since Donny Burger is high in anthocyanins, this step brings out beautiful plum hues.Outdoor growingDonnie Burger seeds are an excellent choice for outdoor growing. The plants enjoy warm, humid climates and are tolerant of occasional temperature changes. Although theyâ€™re naturally resilient, outdoor cultivation poses a few challenges.These plants reach up to five feet outdoors and are prone to overstretching. Apply LST techniques to prevent them from growing too high. This strain lives up to its indica heritage as it grows bushy.Use defoliation to prevent the crops from becoming bushy and promote terpene production. This method mimics the damage that herbivores cause when grazing. It also improves aeration and light penetration.Defoliation triggers the plantâ€™s immune system to produce more terpenes. It does this as a mode of self-defense. Loop off the fan leaves in a controlled motion. Only perform this technique once during vegging and blooming.Odor control is crucial when cultivating Donny Burger outdoors. During flowering time, it releases a dank, funky smell that only cannabis produces. Youâ€™ll love it, but your neighbors may not.Keep other odiferous flora nearby to mask the scent. Excellent options include basil, lavender, and marigolds. These plants also add to the richness of the soil and increase biodiversity. This method is the most effective and economical way to deal with the dank aroma.What climate do Donny Burger feminized seeds prefer?Donny Burger strain seeds thrive in warm, humid climates. The plants tolerate an occasional temperature drop but do best in stable environments. Grow indoors if your area doesnâ€™t meet the requirements.This cannabis cultivar is strong enough to withstand rough terrain. With heavy winds and rain, you risk losing terpenes, which affect potency and flavors. Prepare a tarp or back-up shelter to protect them from extreme conditions.The climate needs depend on the marijuana plant phases. Maintain the perfect relative humidity (RH) and temperature throughout each stage:Seedling: 70% RH and 75â€“85Â°F.Vegging: 50â€“60% RH and 70â€“85Â°F.Flowering 40â€“50% RH and 65â€“80Â°F.Feeding Donny Burger fem seedsThe most essential factor in nutrition is pH. A perfect pH level allows the weed plant to soak up the nutrients easily. The greenery may experience deficiencies if the acid-base levels are imbalanced.The three main nutrients for marijuana are nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). They help plants develop healthy foliage and juicy buds. Incorporate them in different ranges throughout the growing stages.Vegging cannabis crops require extra nitrogen to develop more foliage. Flowering plants donâ€™t need as much. Theyâ€™re more focused on creating plump buds rather than leaves. Feed them more phosphorus and potassium to increase terpenes.Besides NPK nutrients, use these methods to improve bud production and plant health:Mix 5 ml molasses for every liter of water to feed the beneficial microbes in the soil. It boosts the plantâ€™s immune system. It also feeds essential micronutrients like magnesium, selenium, and calcium.Add amino acid foliar spray during flowering. It aids nutrient transportation and provides more proteins.Use beneficial microbes like mycorrhizal fungi to enhance soil health and increase terpenes.Flowering & yieldsThe flowering phase of Donny Burger strain seeds is usually around 9â€“10 weeks. Flush the soil two weeks before harvest for the most delicious buds. This step removes any taste of residual pesticides or nutrients.Indoor growers can speed up the vegging time by using light manipulation techniques. Expect around 10â€“20 oz./mÂ² of buds in a controlled environment. Donny Burger is a heavy-yielder. Outdoors, you may collect about 16 oz./plant of juicy buds.Experiencing the Donny Burger strainDonny Burger offers a culinary experience for cannabis connoisseurs.

Seeds Supreme,https://seedsupreme.com/black-jack-autoflower.html,Black Jack Autoflower,"Roll the Dice if you DareBud BasicsOne word comes to mind when describing Black Jack Autoflower â€“ uncompromising. From top to bottom, everything about this epic strain has hardcore enjoyment written all over it.Best avoided entirely by novices with a low THC tolerance, this stuff regularly tips the scales at more than 25% THC. Which is a lot â€“ more than enough to take seasoned stoners on one hell of a ride.The breeders behind Black Jack Auto were onto a winner from the word go. After all, combining the genetics of Jack Herer and S.A.D. (Sweet Afghan Delicious) was only ever going to result in something remarkable - in this case, an exceptionally potent hybrid with a unique flavor and fragrance, erring slightly towards the Sativa side of the scale.Though thereâ€™s some physical relaxation to the whole experience, Black Jack Autoflower is more about delivering the ultimate cerebral uplift that hits like a jackhammer.If youâ€™re simply out for a basic everyday mood-boost, take your business elsewhere.

The combination of which creates something quite special in this notable specimen.Of course, with such diverse genetic ancestry, you wouldnâ€™t expect anything less than a complex and distinct fragrance. The initial hit is one of sour citrus and somewhat heavy fuel, harking back to thatSour Diesellineage. Thereâ€™s also plenty of sweetness and pine-freshness, underpinned by freshly dug earth and a gentle wave of musk. TheOG Kushancestry of3 Kings Femis also evident in the hint of sandalwood you pick up on when the buds are burned.The flavor profile more or less follows the delectable fragrance notes to the letter.

There is a long-lastingfuel-like aftertastethat borders on acrid, with plenty of peppery spice and a note of exotic hash.These nugs are considered best enjoyed when smoked, though are worth trying with a low-temperature vaporizer for an entirely different experience.EffectsLeaning heavily towards the Sativa side of the spectrum,3 Kings Feminizedis an excellent daytime smoke. Given her moderate THC content that varies from 15% or around 19%, sheâ€™s never going to hit youtoohard and put you completely out of action. The effect is pretty much 100% cerebral at first, flooding the brain with a sense ofoptimism and inspired creativity. Youâ€™ll find yourself brainstorming and thinking creatively on a level you never thought possible, with all pessimism and negative thoughts having been obliterated.This initial headrush can get a little on the â€˜livelyâ€™ side, so proceed with caution if youâ€™re using3 Kingsto get by at work.Likewise, itâ€™s only a matter of time until that Indica heritage creeps into the equation.

Instead, itâ€™s more a case of gradually being eased into a sense of dreamy andfloaty physical relaxation, sending warm and soothing tingles right through the extremities.

Or to put it another way,3 Kings Feminizedis far more than the sum of her component parts.Immediately getting to grips with all types of psychological malaise,3 Kingsis fantastic for alleviating everyday stress, bouts of anxiety and feelings of mild depression.

Therapeutic tokers often turn to these buds for relief from arthritis, joint stiffness, headaches, migraines and more.3 Kingsis also pretty consistent where moderate yet controllable cases of the munchies are concerned, so sheâ€™s great for tackling bouts of nausea or poor appetite.The risk of negative side effects with3 Kings Feminizedis relatively low, as the average THC content isnâ€™t nearly high enough to send novice users over the edge.Growing 3 Kings Feminized Seeds3 Kings Feminizedhas a genetic composition that also makes her an enjoyable strain to grow. Give these beauties free rein and youâ€™ll be looking at plants that top out at around six feet, making them suitable for most indoor and outdoor environments.Sheâ€™s also an extremely forgiving strain in terms of humidity and temperature preferences, while demonstratingexcellent resistanceto common plant problems like mold and pest infestation.The only thing you really need to keep your eye on is the weight of the branches and the buds, which may need some level of support as the plants reach maturity.A 50% humidity level is ideal, alongside temperatures from around 20Â° C to say 26Â°C.3 Kings Feminizedhas a flowering time of approximately 10 weeks, after which indoor yields can reach 600g per square meter â€“ often up to 700g outdoors.

Hints of sandalwood and even lavender can be found in this rich smoke, though the taste of berries and orange will still be most evident - all in all, making for an intense, elaborate attack on the senses from all sides: simultaneously sickly sweet and woody to boot.Soft and creamy,Gelatois a smooth smoke sensation, which might explain its name. Though delicious, this is a seriously pungent strain - important to consider if youâ€™re aiming for discretion.EffectsIf youâ€™re after a strain that encourages creative pursuits, look no further thanGelato Regular. Its effects hit fast and strong - sometimes even before youâ€™ve managed to exhale - but arenâ€™t overwhelming if you donâ€™t overdo it, enhancing your sensory perceptions to the point of near-elation. Everything is better withGelatoholding your hand, and with a few tokes of this mind-altering strain, youâ€™ll find new vibrancy in the world: the dullest of tasks will become suddenly interesting and appealing - and most importantly, you wonâ€™t lose your focus despite your intensified surroundings.Head-heavy in nature, consumers will find themselves first hit with a head rush of awesome cerebral stimulation that leaves you floaty and comfortable, but lucid enough to enjoy the sensation without dozing. Thereâ€™s no sedation or couch-lock here, though thatâ€™s not to say the body buzz isnâ€™t enticing. Some fans ofGelatohave reported the occasional tendency to drop off to sleep immediately after smoking, but most will tell you otherwise. Itâ€™s a perfect strain for use when socialising, with friends, or alone - just like its namesake gelato.SinceGelato Regularis a high THC strain, itâ€™s a specimen recommended for the more seasoned smoker, and novice consumers should proceed with caution. Those with a higher tolerance however, will love the euphoric and amplified psychedelic effects that bring on the occasional sound sensitivity and even time dilation for consumers.

It must be noted, too, that over-consumption could cause mild lightheadedness, dry eyes and cottonmouth, so stay hydrated when smoking this beauty.Growing Gelato RegularGelato Regular might not be a strain for those new to growing marijuana, as the list of requirements can seem intimidating for beginners, but there are tips that can help. Before you get started though, keep in mind that since these are regular seeds, males must be separated to prevent pollination if growing for yields.Physically,Gelatoleans toward the classic attributes of many other Indica strains: imposing in appearance with a large cone shaped cola and clusters of dark green, dense buds. In the right environment,Gelatocan grow as tall as 6 feet, but this can be controlled by employing theScreen of Greentechnique to manage its height while increasing bud production. Force transitioning the plant to the flower stage around two weeks earlier can also help deal with the height, and both methods will improve your yield size.The buds onGelatoare particularly sensitive to higher humidities and vulnerable to pathogen attacks, so take care when growing to maintain ideal room conditions - crucially a relative humidity (RH) levelof 40%-50% for its flowering period, and dropping at the end of the cycle to around 30-40% for the final two weeks.Itâ€™s important to keep an eye on the temperature while growingGelato Regular, too. Between 20-26Â°C where possible, just like the mild, dry summers of California. This, plus a high soil content of magnesium and calcium, a regular prune of the lower branches for light penetration and airflow, and youâ€™re on your way to collecting 500-700 grams of buds per square meter.When the flowers begin to reach maturity, expect to see an opalescent coat of white resin appear, though it has to be noted that some phenotypes ofGelato Regulararenâ€™t as resinous as some of their relatives unless growing conditions are absolutely optimal, due to the short stalks on the trichomes.Gelatoâ€™s buds tend to be small, but thick and dense - gorgeous forest green leaves, highlighted with deep shades of violet and mauve from the high levels ofanthocyaninspresent and fiery orange pistils. If itâ€™s purple youâ€™re after, these colors can be stimulated by colder weather in the last two weeks before harvesting.This strain tends to flower within 8-9 weeks when grown indoors, and like its parents, has a higher than average yield - but be aware thatGelatois a pungent lady. Indoor growers might want to consider some odor control measures.SummaryGelato Regularis a beautifully balanced flavor-profile of delight, if sticky, sickly sweetness is your thing. And if it isnâ€™t, it soon will be with a fruity, smooth taste and aroma thatâ€™s inarguably delicious. Combining the best parts of both of its parents, this is a popular strain for good reason: bold in taste and easy on the eye, itâ€™s a great example of the taste-focused craft hybrids emerging from the West Coast in recent years.Delivering blissful relaxation even in low doses, whilst boosting those creative juices,Gelatois something of an all-rounder for recreational and medicinal use too - an ideal strain for those in need of pain relief for a variety of issues, alongside temporary alleviation of mental health complaints too.

Indoor growers are in for roughly 450 grams per meter squared for their efforts, whilst outdoor harvests can yield up to 450 grams per plant in optimal conditions.While growers in the northern hemisphere who opt for an outdoor setup can see a successful harvest, youâ€™re not in for quite the same generous yields, and youâ€™ll need to harvest by mid-October at the latest.SummaryIf youâ€™re in the market for a marvelous medical marijuana strain with one of the most delicious profiles around, look no further thanCBD Blueberry Feminized- a 16:1 CBD to THC ratio therapeutic bud beast.Reasonably simple to cultivate and abundantly generous (especially considering the medical potency and efficacy of these buds even in small quantities), thesefeminizedseeds are perhaps your easiest route to a high-quality crop of premium therapeutic pot.

This variety of marijuana became famous after winning the Best CBD award at the 2011 High Times Medical Cannabis Cup in California.In the 1970s, cultivators crossed the indica Afghani with the sativa Northern California and a Russian ruderalis. Breeders first grew the resulting ATF strain in the Matanuska valley in Alaska, hence its name.Alaskan Thunderfuck boasts high THC levels of 15â€“27% and low CBD levels of 0â€“2%. Its dominant terpene, myrcene, promotes its talkative and uplifting effects.Growing Alaskan Thunderfuck feminized seedsAlaskan Thunderfuck seeds are moderately challenging to grow.

However, the combination with Northern Lightshas added notes of earth and spice to her fragrance, alongside hints of lemon.Though the invitation to inhale is compelling even before combusting, when you do so, youâ€™ll find her sweet citrus and herb combination is even more alluring to the taste buds, making for a particularly pleasing pot experience.EffectsSmashing together the genetics of two true giants in the cannabis community was sure to end in a hybrid with highs beyond compare, and Northern Lights x Skunk Fem is certainly a ride.Uplifting and yet simultaneously sedating, the psychedelic high of this herb can be traced back to her Skunk lineage, beginning with a rush of energy to the head that both focuses and enlivens you as you toke.

Thanks to that CBD dose, even those new to consuming cannabis should be able to thoroughly enjoy this (utterly delicious) form of therapy, without any risk of adverse side effects.That said, itâ€™s easy to overconsume these buds due to their moreish flavor - you will need some self-control not to overdo it as this can increase the odds of mild cottonmouth or bloodshot eyes.An effective treatment for conditions of the mind and body alike, patients suffering from mild or severe ailments can find their solace with this herb to hand.Fruit Auto is particularly effective at combating negativity in all its forms, offering swift and considerable relief from everything from general malaise to chronic or daily stress, clinical depression, PTSD and even bipolar.On the physical side of things, youâ€™ll find these buds are effective painkillers capable of soothing aches and pains ranging from simple headaches to persistent migraines, arthritis, muscular spasms, PMS cramps and more.There are those who claim this stuff incites a compelling hunger too, capable of combating lost appetites in even those with anorexia, bulimia or undergoing chemotherapy.Growing Fruit Autoflower SeedsAs youâ€™d expect from any quality auto strain, youâ€™re in for a swift and simple cultivation experience when growing Fruit Autoflower. This herb is the definition of a novice-friendly cultivar, and practically guaranteed to reach a healthy harvest regardless of any newbie missteps.With strong Indica genetics and the robustness inherited from Lowryder, this hybrid develops in the expected manner - short and stocky plants which rarely reach much taller than 1 meter and are famously capable of handling themselves, fending off common plant-related problems like mold, pests or pathogens.The auto nature of these beans means your crop will flower regardless of how much light they receive, though for best results youâ€™ll want to treat your plants to a regular 20 hours of steady light.Itâ€™s possible to grow Fruit Autoflower outdoors, even in less hospitable northern hemisphere climates, and even possible to reap your first harvest by April if the seasons behave appropriately - though youâ€™ll have until October to chop your last harvest down, giving you plenty of opportunities to rake in those decadent smelling buds.If youâ€™re able to implement a Sea of Green (SoG) setup, this will go a long way towards helping you reach the biggest possible yields, and youâ€™ll find that both hydroponic and organic soil work well for your growing medium.Choose hydro if you want the most explosive growth possible, or opt for organic to draw out the full terpene profile and maximize that flavor, aroma and medical efficacy.As you can see, itâ€™s hard to go wrong with this highly merciful and undemanding strain, and after as few as 6 or 7 weeks, itâ€™s time to harvest. Indoor growers can expect up to 100 grams per meter squared, while outdoors itâ€™s closer to a potential 150 grams per plant.Before you chop that crop though, take a moment more to revel in the sheer stunning beauty of these resin-frosted nugs and their tapestry of green, russet, yellow and blue hues.SummaryFamously fruity ganja thatâ€™s nothing short of incredibly simply to grow and guaranteed to yield, Fruit Autoflower may not be the most generous or strongest strain going, but that flavor, overall bag appeal and CBD dose more than makes up for that.Calming, clarifying and creatively inspiring, this herb makes a worthy addition to any ganja garden, and is perhaps the easiest way to score a consistent stash of quality buds throughout the year round.  Cannabis affects everyone differently. Your experience with this strain may not be the same as someone elseâ€™s.
