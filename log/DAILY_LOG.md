**Transparent daily(ish) chronicle of building the world's most rigorous cannabis dataset ecosystem.**  
Solo dev, real costs, real setbacks, real breakthroughs.

### Quick Jump to Months
- [January 2026](#january-2026)
- [February 2026](#february-2026)  
*(more months added as we go)*

## January 2026 – The Origin Story

### Jan 1 – Foundation Day
- Launched **ci-strains-pro** repo + README
- Built folder skeleton, roadmap, branding assets, .amazonq rules
- Added licenses & early Python extraction scripts
- Started Gemini Flash 2.0 verification on **15,778 URLs**

### Jan 2 – Validation Victory
- Gemini run finished: **100% processed**
- Fixed **193 broken URLs** → recovered 187, final **15,778 validated strains**
- Dropped full validation report + before/after snippets
- **First transparency milestone** ✅

### Jan 3 – HTML Archive Revolution
- Manual cleaning + kicked off **bulletproof HTML collection** pipeline
- Upgraded vision: Immutable timestamped HTML as **source of truth**
- **Collection COMPLETE**: **14,075 / 15,524 unique URLs** (90.7% success)
- 1,449 flagged "no source of truth"

### Jan 4–5 – Weekend Lineage Deep Dive
- **~32+ hours** manual work: Added structured lineage columns (Parents, Generation, Hybrid Type, Landrace Flags) + seed-to-harvest ranges
- Bug hit: ID column mangled pre-split → Gemini outputs misaligned
- **Recovery**: Rolled back to pre-split backup (saved the day!)
- Built `source_of_truth` column: **90.8%** HTML-verified
- Mood: Frustrated → fired up. **This detour made lineage bulletproof**

### Jan 6 – Phase 3 Breakthrough
- 🎉 **Amazon Q crushed HTML enhancement** 🎉
- **93% success**: Enhanced **13,328 / 14,332 strains** from archived HTML
- Added **8 strategic columns** (terpenes JSON, medical apps 100%, outdoor harvest, etc.)
- Dataset jumped: **41 → 49 columns**
- Phase 3 **COMPLETE** ✅ – ready for monetization polish

### Jan 7 – Seed-Bank Extraction Scale
- 🚀 **Enhanced S3 scraping pivot** 🚀
- Built Neptune-specific processor: **97.8% success** (1,995 / 2,039 URLs)
- Pulled **15 rich columns** (incl. Neptune exclusives: feelings, grow difficulty)
- **Template proven** → ready to scale to Attitude, North Atlantic, Seedsman, etc.

### Jan 8 – Cleanup & Pivot
- Archived old pipeline files to **[TRASH]** folder
- Mental note: Pull original raw data rows for the 1,450 "no source" strains later
- Set `has_source_url = FALSE` flag for transparency

### Jan 10 – Source of Truth Complete
- 🎉 **Phase 2 COMPLETE**: Source of Truth & Inventory system
- **14,840 strain URLs** mapped to seed banks via S3 metadata extraction
- Built complete inventory: `pipeline/02_source_of_truth/s3_complete_inventory.csv`
- All 11 seed banks mapped with exact distribution counts
- **100% HTML archive coverage** achieved

### Jan 11 – Phase 3 Launch
- 🚀 **Phase 3 ACTIVE**: Enhanced S3 Extraction
- **Current Focus**: CSV header analysis vs extraction script capabilities
- All seed bank folders ready in `pipeline/03_enhanced_s3_scraping/`
- **MTD Costs**: AWS $10.77 | Bright Data $41.25 | ScrapingBee $49.99 | Google Cloud $0 (credits)
- **Total Project Cost (11 days)**: $101.01

### Jan 12 – Seedsman Analysis & Phase 3 Status
- 🔍 **Seedsman S3 Analysis**: All 878 HTML files JavaScript-blocked (no usable strain data)
- **Decision**: Skip Seedsman for current extraction phase (maintains data quality)
- 📊 **Phase 3 Status**: **COMPLETE** - 13,766 strains processed across 10 seed banks
- **Record Achievements**: 1,477 max columns (Seed Supreme), 58.4% peak quality (Royal Queen)
- **Coverage**: 100% on 4 banks, 22 Professional tier strains identified
- **Impact**: 878 strains (5.9%) excluded but quality standards maintained

**Next up**: Rescrape Seedsman website for S3 bucket we will continue tomorrow.

## February 2026

### 2026-02-01
- [TBD – momentum building...]

**This log is living proof: setbacks happen, but the grind wins.**  
From Day 1 skeleton to 49-column monster with 93%+ HTML-backed data — all solo.  
Stay tuned – Phase 2 monetization drops soon.
