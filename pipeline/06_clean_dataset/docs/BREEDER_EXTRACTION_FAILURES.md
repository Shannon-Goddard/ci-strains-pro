→ Standardize to: "Brothers Grimm Seeds, Trailer Park Boys, Hemptown Collab"

multiple breeders should have commas for identifying each seed banks as a separate bank

### Seed Supreme
```html
349 strains from Seed Supreme have the SKU: (example:SSSB-3KF-FX) in breeder_extracted

Should be Seedbank: value. Breeder = Seed Supreme

I think it's just when the seed bank and seed breeder is "Seed Supreme"

**Total seed bank's breeders**:   
**Failures documented**:  
**Ready for extraction**: Yes

**Next Steps**:
1. Shannon completes failure documentation
2. Amazon Q builds new seed-bank-specific extraction scripts
3. Re-extract breeder names from S3 HTML files
4. Merge with existing dataset
5. Verify 100% coverage
