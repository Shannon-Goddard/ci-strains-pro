Grape Crush began as the free strain from our 2023 Sundae Thumper drop, never intended to be the star, yet from the first grows she made it clear she had other plans. Word travelled fast, jars emptied faster, and the Grape Crush Gang on Discord quickly let us know she deserved more than a cameo. Her planned Limited Edition run in 2024 only added fuel to the fire, and when she left the catalogue in early 2025 the outcry was louder than anything we had heard in a long time. So here she is, resurrected as a proud member of our Reserva line. Grape Crush grows with effortless confidence, dense and bushy yet incredibly beginner-friendly, happy with feed, unfazed by pot ups and quick to frost over. Her aroma leans dank and musky with grape and a touch of gas, settling into a fuller grape profile once cured, with the occasional rare blueberry twist. The effects are warm, euphoric and deeply relaxing without wiping you out, with a steady body melt and a mood softening glow that translates beautifully into edibles too. Altogether, she is a proper grape-forward banger, brought back by popular demand and here to stay.",,,,gas,,,F1,Skip to content,,,,,False,html/b64c65c3d6e365a4.html,,2026-01-12T17:20:03.374756,,https://mephistogenetics.com/products/mephistos-grape-crush,,,,,,,,,,,Mephisto Genetics
