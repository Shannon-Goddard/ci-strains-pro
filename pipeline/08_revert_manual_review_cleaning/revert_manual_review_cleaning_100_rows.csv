This genetic lineage enhances its resistance to climate adversities. Predominantly Sativa, Maltezerz is celebrated for its exceptional production of trichomes and terpenes, making it an ideal candidate for high-quality aromatic extractions and concentrates. It is a high-yielding plant, straightforward to cultivate both indoors and outdoors. Indoor growers can expect harvests of 500-600 gr/m2 after a relatively short flowering period of 63 days (less than 9 weeks). Outdoor cultivators in the Northern Hemisphere can anticipate yields of around 700 gr/plant, with harvest typically occurring from mid-end September to early October. The flavor profile is complex and rich, featuring notes of gassy candied Zkittlez, sweet fruitiness with a spicy undertone, and even hints of chocolate or cocoa. Maltezerz delivers a strong high, making it perfect for evening use or a relaxing night in.",3,The provided webpage content was irrelevant to the strain description.
