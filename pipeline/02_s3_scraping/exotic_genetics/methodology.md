## Exotic Genetix Extraction

### Minimal Extraction Pipeline
1. **Strain Name** - h2.product_title
2. **Description** - Mother, Reversal, Sex, Pack Size
3. **Meta** - SKU and Category
4. **Genetics** - Combined Mother x Reversal

### Limited Data Structure
Exotic Genetix pages contain minimal cultivation data:
- Focus on genetics (Mother/Reversal)
- SKU and category for organization
- No THC/CBD, yield, or flowering data available
