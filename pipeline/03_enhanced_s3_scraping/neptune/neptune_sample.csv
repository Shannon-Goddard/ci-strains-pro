Zombie Storm Strain Feminized Seeds by White Clouds Genetics

What Are Zombie Storm Seeds?
Zombie Storm strain seeds by White Clouds Genetics combine Zombified and Shitstorm S1 to form a heavily sedating, visually striking feminized hybrid. Known for its grimy gas, deep coloration, and powerful couch-lock, this strain was designed for fans of old-school funk with modern frost. Each 6-pack contains all-female seeds, making them a consistent and reliable choice for serious growers.

Structure and Appearance
Zombie Storm produces dense, chunky flowers wrapped in thick trichomes. Expect deep greens, purples, and occasional jet-black hues, especially in colder climates. The plant structure stays short and bushy, with tight spacing and strong lateral branches, making it a solid fit for indoor tents or sea-of-green setups.

Flavor and Aroma Profile
This strain reeks in the best way—expect rancid gas, burnt rubber, and earthy skunk up front, followed by hints of spice and fermented fruit. Zombified provides the dirty funk, while Shitstorm S1 adds a fuel-heavy, chemical-rich backbone. It’s the kind of aroma that fills the room before you even open the jar.

Effects and Medicinal Benefits
Zombie Storm is deeply relaxing, delivering a heavy body stone and mental sedation. Ideal for nighttime use, it can help manage insomnia, chronic stress, muscle tension, and appetite loss. It’s not for the faint of heart—expect strong, long-lasting effects that can flatten even seasoned smokers.

Growing Zombie Storm at Home
This feminized hybrid has a flowering time of 8-9 weeks and thrives in low to moderate-height setups. It responds well to defoliation and minor training techniques, and its sturdy frame can support heavy colas with ease. Zombie Storm is also a strong choice for solventless hash making thanks to its resin output.

Why Choose Zombie Storm Seeds?
Zombie Storm seeds are ideal for growers seeking loud funk, purple frost, and serious body effects. With unique genetics from Zombified and Shitstorm S1, this cultivar offers a memorable terp profile and a true end-of-day experience. Grab your 6-pack of feminized seeds now at Neptune Seed Bank.

Williams Wonder. This 1980s Super Sativa Seed Club icon leans indica. Moreover, it is remembered for massive calyxes, big yields, citrus-skunk terps, and deep physical relaxation.
Gas Casket. Staten Island Chem × Hotcakes is dense, loud, and sticky. Additionally, Hotcakes (Katsu Bubba Kush × Burnt Toast) contributes structure, resin, and a slow-building sledgehammer effect.

Buy Thai Neville’s Haze x Northern Lights #5 Cannabis Seeds - Neptune Seed Bank
Thai Neville’s Haze x Northern Lights #5 feminized seeds from Katsu Seeds combine two icons from opposite ends of the cannabis spectrum. On one side is Thai Neville’s Haze, a landrace-inspired hybrid with soaring, psychedelic highs. On the other is Northern Lights #5, a late-’80s indica clone known for fast finishes, structure, and narcotic weight. Together, they create hybrids with serious resin, wide expression, and balanced intensity.
Key Information


Strain Name: Thai Neville’s Haze x Northern Lights #5


Lineage: Thai Neville’s Haze x Northern Lights #5


Seed Type: Feminized Seeds


Seeds Per Pack: 6


Breeder: Katsu Seeds


Flavor, Aroma & Effects
The terpene profile swings across a wide range. Haze phenos lean toward spice, incense, and pine fuel. Northern Lights phenos, however, bring plum-pepper funk, earthy sweetness, and hash-like depth. As a result, the flowers are layered and unique.
The high also shows dual influence. At first, the haze side delivers a clear, euphoric lift that can feel electric. Soon after, Northern Lights #5 grounds the experience with dense, narcotic calm. Therefore, this hybrid is both uplifting and body-heavy. For some, it even carries a psychedelic edge.


Aromas: Spice, incense, pine, plum funk, earthy hash


Flavors: Spiced fuel, citrus pine, earthy sweetness


Effects: Euphoric, mentally bright, physically heavy, balanced


Growing Thai Neville’s Haze x Northern Lights #5
This hybrid offers a wide range of growth patterns. Thai Neville’s Haze stretches tall, produces minimal leaf, and builds long towers of silver frost. NL5, in contrast, keeps plants shorter, denser, and faster to finish. In many cases, growers will find hybrids that fall in the middle.
Flowering takes 10-12 weeks, depending on pheno. Yields are high, especially when the vigor of haze meets the density of NL5. In addition, resin production is heavy across all expressions, making this hybrid a strong choice for extraction.


Difficulty: Moderate to advanced; training is recommended


Structure: Tall spears or squat resin-packed colas


Flowering Time: 10-12 weeks


Yields: High; frosty buds with early trichome coverage


Why Choose Thai Neville’s Haze x Northern Lights #5?


Brings together two legendary strains with opposite traits


Produces wide pheno variety for hunters and breeders


Offers bold terpene mixes of spice, incense, earth, and fruit


Feminized seeds ensure female plants only


A collector’s choice for old-world hybrids

What Are Mello Nilla Seeds?
Mello Nilla strain seeds by Square One Genetics blend the sweet, creamy flavors of Marshmallow OG with the terp-heavy Banana Butter Cups (BBC).

Whether you’re after unique flavor or relaxing effects, Mello Nilla delivers. It’s easy to grow, resin-rich, and designed to stand out in any garden.

What Mello Nilla Looks Like
Mello Nilla produces medium-height plants with dense, frosty buds. Flowers develop a light green base with creamy yellow undertones and bright orange hairs. The trichome coverage is heavy, especially near harvest, giving the buds a frosted look. Structurally, it’s bushy and well-suited for both topping and SCROG setups.

Aroma and Flavor Profile
Break open the buds and you’ll instantly notice Mello Nilla’s sweet, dessert-like aroma. Expect heavy vanilla, light marshmallow, and a warm buttery finish from the BBC side. As the flowers cure, more creamy notes come through, along with a touch of earth and gas. These terpenes shine in both flower and hash.

Mello Nilla Effects
This strain is known for its mellow, feel-good vibe. It starts with a gentle mental uplift, followed by full-body calm. Many users say it helps quiet the mind without heavy sedation. Because of this balance, Mello Nilla seeds are great for winding down, relaxing after work, or enjoying a peaceful evening.

Medicinal Benefits of Mello Nilla
Medical users may enjoy Mello Nilla for its stress-reducing and muscle-relaxing qualities. It may also ease anxiety or racing thoughts without feeling overwhelming. Those with mild insomnia or mood swings might find some relief too. Its smooth terpene profile makes it a gentle, functional medicinal option.

Growing Mello Nilla at Home
Mello Nilla seeds are beginner-friendly and respond well to various techniques. Flowering finishes in around 8-9 weeks. The plant thrives in both indoor and outdoor environments and adapts well to low-stress training. Expect strong lateral branching and solid yields. Thanks to its frost and terp profile, it’s a great candidate for extraction.

Mello Nilla Strain Seeds Are a Must-Have
Mello Nilla offers creamy vanilla flavor, relaxing effects, and solid yields—all in one feminized seed pack. The cross of Marshmallow OG x BBC brings sweet terps and high resin production to the table. It’s easy to grow, hash-friendly, and pairs perfectly with an evening smoke session.

What Are L.A. Zkittlez F2 Seeds?
L.A. Zkittlez F2 Strain seeds by breeder “42” offer a stabilized and refined version of the beloved L.A. Zkittlez, which itself is a cross of L.A. Kush and Zkittlez. This 10-pack of regular indica-dominant seeds brings together the fuel-forward funk of L.A. Kush with the tropical candy sweetness of Zkittlez, creating a strain that’s deeply relaxing, terpene-rich, and built for both flower and hash.

Structure and Appearance

Zkittlez F2 produces vibrant green nugs with streaks of purple, often dusted in heavy trichomes. The plant responds well to topping and thrives in both small spaces and full canopy setups.

Flavor and Aroma Profile
Expect a sweet and gassy terp profile, blending ripe tropical candy with earthy kush and diesel. On the inhale, it’s fruity and smooth. On the exhale, it hits with a satisfying skunk and sour fuel finish. The scent fills the room and lingers long after you’ve broken down the bud.

Effects and Medicinal Use
L.A. Zkittlez F2 strain seeds produce flower that leans heavily toward deep relaxation and physical calm, making it ideal for nighttime use. Users report relief from anxiety, chronic stress, insomnia, and body aches. The soothing high settles in fast and sticks around, offering a stoney yet functional experience.

Growing L.A. Zkittlez F2 Seeds
These regular seeds finish in about 8-9 weeks and perform well indoors and outdoors. L.A. Zkittlez F2 is easy to manage, mold-resistant, and highly productive with minimal training. Its excellent resin production and terpene profile also make it a favorite among solventless extractors.

Holy Grail S1 feminized seeds from Katsu Seeds revive one of the most iconic strains of the early 2010s.

Aromas: Diesel, pine, citrus, earthy hash


Flavors: Kush spice, citrus, hashy sweetness


Effects: Relaxing, therapeutic, functional, body calm

What Head Mount Smells Like
This strain bursts with the aroma of sweet citrus and tropical fruit, led by sharp limonene and supported by earthy myrcene and floral linalool. Notes of tangerine zest and grapefruit lift the nose, followed by sweet wood and peppery spice. As you break apart the bud, the sour orange rind becomes more prominent and energizing. The scent profile feels bright yet grounded, perfect for day-to-evening use.

Head Mount Effects
Head Mount delivers a euphoric headspace while gently relaxing the body. You may notice an initial uplift in mood and focus, perfect for artistic or thought-driven tasks.

Goblin Mode Strain Feminized Seeds by White Clouds Genetics

What Are Goblin Mode Seeds?
Goblin Mode strain seeds from White Clouds Genetics unleash a chaotic hybrid built for terp heads and heavy-hitters. Created by crossing Pablos Revenge with Zombie Storm, this feminized strain combines loud funk, dense frost, and full-body potency. Each 6-pack offers all-female seeds, making it easy to grow sinister flower with maximum aroma and impact.

Structure and Appearance
Goblin Mode grows short and stocky, with a rugged appearance and thick resin-dripping colas. The buds show off deep greens, blackish purples, and frosty white trichomes that give it an eerie shine under grow lights. Its strong lateral branching and tight internodes make it ideal for indoor cultivation.

Flavor and Aroma Profile
Expect an intense gas-and-garlic nose with undertones of fermented fruit and earthy funk. Pablos Revenge brings sharp diesel notes, while Zombie Storm layers in skunky decay and chemical spice. On the palate, it tastes like spiced fuel with hints of sweet rot, appealing to fans of exotic and aggressive terp profiles.

Effects and Medicinal Benefits
Goblin Mode hits hard and fast, delivering a foggy, euphoric head high followed by deep physical sedation. Great for nighttime use, it may help ease chronic stress, anxiety, tension, and insomnia. While beginners should proceed with caution, seasoned users will love its heavy, therapeutic punch.

Growing Goblin Mode at Home
This feminized strain flowers in 8 to 9 weeks and performs best in controlled indoor or greenhouse environments. It responds well to low-stress training, and its thick structure holds up during late flower. With above-average trichome coverage, Goblin Mode is also a strong choice for solventless hash and live rosin.

Why Choose Goblin Mode Seeds?
Goblin Mode seeds deliver unapologetic terps, crazy frost, and knockout effects bred into one aggressive, easy-to-grow plant. This Pablos Revenge x Zombie Storm cross is loud, bold, and built for fans of gas-heavy cultivars.

Structure and Appearance
Fudgie F1 grows low and wide, developing strong lateral branches and thick central colas. Buds form chunky and dense, often expressing shades of forest green, deep purple, and silver-white resin.

This strain delivers a mouth-coating mix of sweet chocolate, earthy kush, and gassy undertones. Pure Michigan brings dessert-style terps like creamy vanilla and dank funk, while Romulan adds herbal spice and pine. On the inhale, it tastes sweet and rich; on the exhale, you’ll notice a nutty, kushy finish. The scent lingers in jars, rooms, and rolling trays—loud and unforgettable.

Effects and Medicinal Benefits
Fudgie F1 delivers a deeply relaxing experience that eases the body and softens the mind. The high sets in quickly with a heady buzz, then melts into a tranquil, full-body calm.

Buy Durban Poison x Northern Lights #5 Cannabis Seeds - Neptune Seed Bank
Durban Poison x Northern Lights #5 feminized seeds from Katsu Seeds bring together two legends. On one side is Durban Poison, a pure South African landrace known for clarity and energy. On the other side is Northern Lights #5, a late-’80s indica clone celebrated for density, potency, and fast finishing. Combined, they create hybrids with big yields, unique terps, and a high that blends focus with relaxation.
Key Information


Strain Name: Durban Poison x Northern Lights #5


Lineage: Durban Poison x Northern Lights #5


Seed Type: Feminized Seeds


Seeds Per Pack: 6


Breeder: Katsu Seeds


Flavor, Aroma & Effects
The terpene spectrum is wide. Durban Poison adds citrus peel, pine, and anise. Northern Lights #5 contributes plum funk, spice, and hashy depth. As a result, the flavors range from bright and sharp to earthy and musky.
The effects also move in stages. First, Durban delivers a clear, uplifting energy that suits daytime use. Later, NL5 slows things down with deep muscle relaxation and calm sedation. Therefore, this strain works well for growers who want balance in both mind and body.


Aromas: Citrus, pine, earthy spice, plum funk


Flavors: Anise, gas, licorice, cedar, hash


Effects: Uplifting, functional, relaxing, body-heavy finish


Growing Durban Poison x Northern Lights #5
This cross tempers the tall stretch of Durban with the compact, stocky frame of NL5. Plants stay manageable indoors yet still produce long colas outdoors.
Flowering typically takes 9-10 weeks, and yields are high. In addition, trichomes appear early, giving flowers a frosty look by mid-flower. For extractors, resin production makes this hybrid even more appealing.


Difficulty: Moderate; responds well to training


Structure: Tall with strength; tighter spacing from NL5


Flowering Time: 9-10 weeks


Yields: High; resin-rich dense colas


Why Choose Durban Poison x Northern Lights #5?

Climate: With stable VPD and moderate feeding, resin and density stay high.
Finish: Typically 8-9 weeks indoors; outdoors, plan for early fall in warm, dry regions.
Hash makers: In particular, expect strong solventless potential thanks to notable trichome density.

Additionally, a cool final week often enhances color while preserving candy aromatics.

Air Wolf Strain Regular Seeds - Colab with Katsu Seeds

What Are Air Wolf Strain Regular Seeds?
Air Wolf regular seeds by Katsu Seeds combine two potent cultivars—Dogwalker OG and Romulan—into a hybrid with strong aroma, resin production, and full-spectrum effects. Dogwalker OG contributes its unmistakable skunk and diesel notes, while Romulan adds pine, depth, and hard-hitting body relief. This 12-pack of regular seeds gives growers a range of unique phenotypes and breeding potential, all backed by Romulan and Katsu’s legendary genetics.

Structure and Appearance
Air Wolf plants grow with a sturdy, branching structure and solid apical dominance. Their thick stalks support fat colas that finish dense, frosty, and loud. Buds tend to be lime green with patches of purple and heavy trichome coverage. These plants handle topping and training well, making them ideal for growers looking to maximize canopy space.

Flavor and Aroma Profile
This strain brings together the best of both parents: sharp gas and pine, layered with earthy skunk and subtle fruit. Dogwalker OG contributes heavy diesel and animal funk, while Romulan infuses herbal spice and forest-floor depth. On the inhale, you’ll catch a mix of citrus-kush and fuel; on the exhale, a long-lasting woodsy funk lingers. This one fills the room and the jar—fast.

Effects and Medicinal Benefits
Air Wolf delivers a balanced hybrid high that starts with a cerebral buzz before sinking into a relaxing body effect. Users often experience clear-headed focus at first, followed by a heavy-eyed calm. As a result, it’s a great evening strain, especially for those seeking physical relief without mental cloudiness. Medicinal users may turn to Air Wolf for chronic pain, anxiety, inflammation, or sleep support.

Growing Air Wolf Regular Seeds
Air Wolf flowers in approximately 9-10 weeks and performs well in both indoor and outdoor grows. Regular seeds allow for full genetic exploration, making them ideal for pheno hunters and breeders. Plants thrive under moderate feeding and benefit from defoliation in late veg and early bloom. With the right environment, expect above-average yields and high terpene output.

Why Choose Air Wolf Seeds?
Air Wolf seeds bring elite genetics, complex gas-forward flavor, and full-body strength in one aggressive hybrid. Bred by Katsu Seeds—a name synonymous with OG excellence—this strain offers consistency, bag appeal, and therapeutic potency.
