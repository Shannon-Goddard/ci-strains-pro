Overview
Buy White Rhino x Gas Casket if you want knockout weight, dense resin, and room-filling aroma. First, White Rhino contributes Afghani and White Widow traits that favor big structure and deep relaxation.
Next, Gas Casket adds New York diesel power with garlic, rubber, and caramelized funk. As a result, expect monster colas, sticky flowers, and a classic-meets-modern flavor lane. Finally, the 8-10 week window keeps planning straightforward for most grow rooms.

Parental Lineage Deep Dive
White Rhino. First, this late-â€™90s classic traces to Afghani Ã— White Widow. Moreover, it is known for heavy sedation, oversized buds, and earthy, spicy funk that defined early medical markets.
Gas Casket. Next, Staten Island Chem Ã— Hotcakes brings diesel, chem, garlic, and warm bakery notes. Additionally, Hotcakes adds resin, color, and cookie-batter sweetness that rounds the profile.
Why it works. Therefore, this cross stacks hash-plant density over industrial gas and bakery tones. Consequently, you get a loud, sticky hybrid with serious bag appeal and extraction promise.

Terpene Profile


Dominant: caryophyllene (peppery spice), myrcene (earthy), humulene (herbal).


Supporting: limonene (citrus lift), linalool (floral), ocimene (sweet). Additionally, expression may vary by phenotype.


Taste Profile


Inhale: diesel, garlic, and rubber.


Exhale: spiced earth with burnt sugar and cookie cream.


Aftertaste: lingering chem fuel with warm spice.


Grow Profile


Vigor/structure: Generally medium height with heavy lateral growth and elephant-foot cola potential.


Training: Additionally, top early, apply LST, and trellis for support since colas gain weight late.


Environment: However, maintain steady VPD and moderate EC; strong airflow reduces microclimates in large flowers.


Timing: Typically 8-10 weeks indoors; outdoors in warm, dry regions finishes late September to early October.


Odor control: Very loud; therefore, use carbon filtration and plan intake/exhaust carefully.


Hash potential: Furthermore, abundant trichomes often favor solventless.


Medical Effects Profile


Users report: strong body relaxation, heavy eyes, and deep calm.


May help with: stress, restlessness, and post-work recovery.


Use time: evening or low-agenda days.


Disclaimer: Effects vary by person and setting. This is not medical advice.



Aroma, Flavor, and Experience


Aromas: Firstly, earthy hash and musk lead. Then diesel, garlic, and chem roll in with caramelized sweetness.


Flavors: Initially, gas dominates the front palate. Afterwards, bakery notes round the finish with burnt sugar and cookie cream.


Experience: To start, onset is quick and heavy. Subsequently, a tranquil, grounding cruise settles in for the remainder.



Terp focus: additionally, the gas-plus-dessert lane suits both flower and rosin.

Buy Thai Nevilleâ€™s Haze x Northern Lights #5 Cannabis Seeds - Neptune Seed Bank
Thai Nevilleâ€™s Haze x Northern Lights #5 feminized seeds from Katsu Seeds combine two icons from opposite ends of the cannabis spectrum. On one side is Thai Nevilleâ€™s Haze, a landrace-inspired hybrid with soaring, psychedelic highs. On the other is Northern Lights #5, a late-â€™80s indica clone known for fast finishes, structure, and narcotic weight. Together, they create hybrids with serious resin, wide expression, and balanced intensity.
Key Information


Strain Name: Thai Nevilleâ€™s Haze x Northern Lights #5


Lineage: Thai Nevilleâ€™s Haze x Northern Lights #5


Seed Type: Feminized Seeds


Seeds Per Pack: 6


Breeder: Katsu Seeds


Flavor, Aroma & Effects
The terpene profile swings across a wide range. Haze phenos lean toward spice, incense, and pine fuel. Northern Lights phenos, however, bring plum-pepper funk, earthy sweetness, and hash-like depth. As a result, the flowers are layered and unique.
The high also shows dual influence. At first, the haze side delivers a clear, euphoric lift that can feel electric. Soon after, Northern Lights #5 grounds the experience with dense, narcotic calm. Therefore, this hybrid is both uplifting and body-heavy. For some, it even carries a psychedelic edge.


Aromas: Spice, incense, pine, plum funk, earthy hash


Flavors: Spiced fuel, citrus pine, earthy sweetness


Effects: Euphoric, mentally bright, physically heavy, balanced


Growing Thai Nevilleâ€™s Haze x Northern Lights #5
This hybrid offers a wide range of growth patterns. Thai Nevilleâ€™s Haze stretches tall, produces minimal leaf, and builds long towers of silver frost. NL5, in contrast, keeps plants shorter, denser, and faster to finish. In many cases, growers will find hybrids that fall in the middle.
Flowering takes 10-12 weeks, depending on pheno. Yields are high, especially when the vigor of haze meets the density of NL5. In addition, resin production is heavy across all expressions, making this hybrid a strong choice for extraction.


Difficulty: Moderate to advanced; training is recommended


Structure: Tall spears or squat resin-packed colas


Flowering Time: 10-12 weeks


Yields: High; frosty buds with early trichome coverage


Why Choose Thai Nevilleâ€™s Haze x Northern Lights #5?


Brings together two legendary strains with opposite traits


Produces wide pheno variety for hunters and breeders


Offers bold terpene mixes of spice, incense, earth, and fruit


Feminized seeds ensure female plants only


A collectorâ€™s choice for old-world hybrids
