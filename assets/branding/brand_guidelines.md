# CI-Strains Brand & Badge Guidelines

## 🌿 The "Powered by CI" Promise
The **Cannabis Intelligence (CI)** badge is a visual seal of data integrity.  
When displayed, it certifies that the underlying dataset or application is powered by the CI-Strains database — a product of rigorous manual normalization, AI-driven validation, and human oversight.

## 1. Official Badge Assets
All files are in `/assets/branding/` in this repository:

- `ci-badge-color.svg` — Full-color version (recommended for most uses)
- `ci-badge-white.svg` — White monochrome (dark backgrounds)
- `ci-badge-black.svg` — Black monochrome (light backgrounds/print)
- PNG versions available for legacy needs

## 2. Usage Tiers
- **Personal Use**: Encouraged on grow logs, blogs, research projects, or non-commercial sites.
- **Commercial Use**: Required for all Commercial License holders when displaying CI data publicly (e.g., product pages, apps, marketing).

## 3. Visual Requirements
To preserve the professional "Intelligence" aesthetic:

- **Clear Space**: Minimum breathing room around the badge = height of the "C" in "Cannabis".
- **No Distortion**: Never stretch, skew, rotate, or recolor the badge.
- **Color Guidelines**:
  - Full Color → white/light-grey backgrounds
  - White Monochrome → dark/high-contrast backgrounds
  - Black Monochrome → grayscale/print materials

## 4. Linking & Attribution
On websites/apps, always link the badge back to the source repo for verification:
