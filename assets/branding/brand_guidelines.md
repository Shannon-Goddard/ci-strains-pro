# CI-Strains Brand & Badge Guidelines

## 🌿 The "Powered by CI" Promise
The **Cannabis Intelligence (CI)** badge is a seal of data integrity. When displayed, it signifies that the underlying dataset or application is powered by the CI-Strains database—a product of rigorous manual normalization and AI-driven validation.

## 1. Official Badge Assets
All official assets are located in the `/assets/branding/` folder of this repository.

* **SVG Format**: Recommended for web use to ensure crisp scaling at any resolution.
* **PNG Format**: Provided for legacy systems or simple document embedding.

## 2. Usage Tiers
* **Personal Use**: You are encouraged to display the badge on personal grow logs or research projects.
* **Commercial Use**: Use of the badge is required for all holders of a Commercial License when displaying CI data publicly (e.g., on a seed bank product page).

## 3. Visual Requirements
To maintain the professional "Intelligence" aesthetic, please follow these rules:

* **Clear Space**: Maintain a minimum "breathing room" around the badge equal to the height of the "C" in "Cannabis".
* **No Distortion**: Do not stretch, skew, or rotate the logo.
* **Color Selection**:
    * Use the **Full Color** badge on white or light-grey backgrounds.
    * Use the **White Monochrome** badge on dark or high-contrast backgrounds.
    * Use the **Black Monochrome** badge for grayscale print materials.

## 4. Link & Attribution
Whenever the badge is used on a website or app, it must link back to the official repository to allow users to verify the data provenance:
`https://github.com/your-username/ci-strains-pro`

## 5. Prohibited Use
* Do not use the CI badge to imply endorsement of non-validated data or illegal activities.
* Do not modify the "Power Icon" leaf or the typography.
