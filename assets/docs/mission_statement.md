Our Mission
"To establish the global standard for Cannabis Intelligence (CI) through transparent, validated, and actionable data."

At CI-Strains, we believe that the future of cultivation lies at the intersection of human expertise and artificial intelligence. Our mission is to:

Bridge the Gap: Provide a clean "Source of Truth" for breeders, developers, and researchers.

Ensure Transparency: Document every cleaning step—from manual Excel standardization to AI extraction—to ensure complete data integrity.

Empower Innovation: Provide the foundational "intelligence" that allows others to build the next generation of cultivation apps and research tools.
