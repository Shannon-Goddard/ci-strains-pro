The CI "Power-Up" Icon
The Cannabis Intelligence (CI) logo is a fusion of two universal symbols: the Global Power Icon and the Cannabis Leaf.

The Symbol: The broken circle represents an open system of data exchange, while the cannabis leaf serves as the "switch" that completes the circuit.

The Concept: It signifies that our data is the engine that "powers up" modern cultivation. When you see this icon, it indicates that the underlying intelligence has been activated through our rigorous manual and AI-driven pipeline.

The Direction: The downward-pointing leaf mimics a "Data Ingestion" arrow, symbolizing the precision with which we pull raw botanical information into our structured, validated ecosystem.
